GameFAQs » FAQsWould you recommend this FAQ? Yes NoGame Script by El GrecoMENU I should've known you were behind this, Colonel. That's no way to greet an old war buddy Snake. What do you want from me? I just invited you here so we could have a talk. Invited!? That's what you call sending armed soldiers after me? Sorry if they were a little rough with you. But we've got a serious           situation here. Only you can get us out of it. I'm retired from FOX-HOUND. You're not my commander anymore, and I           don't have to take orders from you or anyone else. You will take these orders. I know it. Excuse me. Who's this? Dr. Naomi Hunter. She's chief of FOX-HOUND's medical staff and an           expert in gene therapy. Are you military? No, civilian. I've been sent here from ATGC. Pleasure to meet you  Don't worry this injection won't hurt a bit. What's the shot for? What's wrong? You don't like shots? Snake listen up. It all went down five hours ago. Heavily armed           soliders occupied Shadow Moses Island, a remote island off the           coast of Alaska. What soldiers? Next-Generation Special Forces led by members of unit FOX-HOUND.           They've presented Washington with a single demand, and they say           that if it isn't met, they'll launch a nuclear weapon. A nuclear weapon? I'm afraid so. You see, the island is the site of a secret nuclear           weapons disposal facility. FOX-HOUND hijacking a nuclear weapon? Now you understand how serious the situation is. You'll have two           mission objectives. First, you're to rescue the DARPA (Defense           Advanced Research Projects Agency) Chief, Donald Anderson, and the           president of ArmsTech, Kenneth Baker. They're both being held as           hostages. Those are some heavy duty hostages. Secondly, you're to investigate whether or not the terrorists have           the ability to launch a nuclear strike, and stop them if they do.           Any questions, Snake? Questions? I haven't even said whether I'd accept this mission. Well you can make up your mind after you hear more about the           situation. Tell me about the nuclear weapons disposal facility. The disposal facility includes a hardened underground base. Even           with our most advanced intelligence gathering equipment, we can't           tell what's happening inside. So someone needs to penetrate, gather intelligence, and report           back... Sounds like a spy movie. What's the insertion method? Well an air insertion is impossible. Not with this storm going on. We'll approach the disposal facility by sub. Approach? Yes, within a few miles of it. The facility is equipped with sonar           detection capability. They'd be able to hear our engine or           propeller noise. And then? We'll launch a one-man SDV (swimmer delivery vehicle). Launch? Same as a torpedo. Only this has no propulsion device of its own.           After the SDV gets as close as it can, dispose of it. From there           on you'll have to swim. You want me to swim in sub-zero Alaskan water? Don't worry. That suit represents the latest advances in poly-           thermal technology. The nuclear weapons disposal facility covers           the whole island. I'll contact you by Codec after you reach your           target. Anyone going with me? As usual, this is a one-man inflitration mission. Weapons and equipment OSP (on-site procurement)? Yes. This a top-secret black op. Don't expect any official support. The Chief of DARPA and the president of an arms manufacturing           company... what business did they have at a nuclear weapons           disposal facility? The truth is that secret exercises were being conducted at the time           the terrorist group attacked. Must be extremely important exercises if those two were directly           involved. Were they testing some kind of new advanced weapon? I'm not privy to that information. Do we know exactly where they're being held? The DARPA chief has also been injected with a mini-transmitter. As           you get closer you should be able to pick up his location on your           radar. Do they really have the ability to launch a nuclear missile? They say they do. They even gave us the serial number of the           warhead they plan to use. Was the number confirmed? I'm afraid so. At the very least, they've got their hands on a real           nuclear warhead. Isn't there some kind of safety device to prevent this kind of           terrorism? Yes. Every missile and warhead in our arsenal is equipped with a           PAL, which uses a discreet detonation code. PAL? Permissive Action Link. A safety control system built into all           nuclear weapons systems. But even so, we can't rest easy. Why not? Because the DARPA Chief knows the detonation code. But even if they have a nuclear warhead, it must've been removed           from its missile. All the missiles on these disposal sites are           supposed to be dismantled. It's not that easy to get your hands on           an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missle). That used to be true, but since the end of the Cold War you can get           anything if you have enough money and the right connections. So what exactly are they demanding? A person's remains. Remains? That's right. To be more accurate, cell specimens which contain the           individual's genomic information. Cell specimens? Why would they want that? The terrorists need them. You see these Next-Generation Special           Forces have been strengthened through gene therapy. Strengthened? You've heard of the Human Genome Project. They've been mapping the           human genome, and they're nearly finished. Following up on this           research, the military has been working towards identifiying those           genes which are responsible for making effective soldiers. There are genes that do that? Yes, and using gene therapy they're able to transplant those genes           into regular soldiers. Gene therapy? I'll explain this part. With gene therapy, we can remove those           genes which we know may lead to sickness or disease, and that the           same time, splice in genes with beneficial effects such as           resistance to cancer for example. In other words, we can overcome all sorts of genetic diseases and           at the same time add genetic characteristics as desired. Okay, and so if you knew what genes were responsible for making           the perfect soldier, you could implant them in the same way, right? Yes we could. But it all depends on being able to isolate and identify those           "soldier genes". And in order to do that, it's helpful to study the genomic           information of one of the greatest soldiers ever. One of the greatest soldiers ever? The man they call the greatest warrior of the twentieth century. You don't mean Big Boss?! That's right. We've been working feverishly to identify the genes           responsible for his incredible combat skill. So far we've           discovered about sixty of the so-called "soldier genes." So his body was recovered after all. Yes, and his cells have remained frozen in cryo-chamber. His           genomic information is a priceless treasure to mankind. Priceless to the military perhaps. His body was burned severely, but it was possible to restore his           DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) profile from just a single strand of           his hair. You people are amazing. And then you're going to transplant those           genes into soldiers? Yes. We'll use a process that I discovered called gene targeting.           The strongest soldiers don't become what they are by acquiring           their skills through training or experience, we now know that           hereditary factors are far more crucial for creating superior           soldiers. Snake, we can't give them his body. It's potentially more dangerous           than all the warheads on that island put together. I hear the terrorists are calling themselves the "Sons of Big           Boss." The Sons of Big Boss. What's the time limit? 24 hours. They say they'll launch after 24 hours. Did they say what the target will be? So far they haven't mentioned a target. When did the countdown start? 5 hours ago. Colonel, who are you speaking for? Naturally, I'm representing the US government. So who's in supervisory control of this operation? The President of the United States. Which means that the President must be meeting with his top aides           in the map room about now, huh? No at this point they're still video conferencing with each other. If that's a real nuclear warhead, shouldn't they issue a COG           (Continuity of Government)? Not yet. The Secretary of Defense has operational control and is           fully aware of the situation. After you infiltrate, if you           determine they possess nuclear launch capabilities a COG will be           issued. Well if they haven't relocated to nuclear shelter under Mount           Washingtion, I suppose there isn't that much reason to worry yet.           Is the National Security Agency in on this? Yes. So is the DIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency. The DIA? I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this. They'll be sending us some support. We don't need desk jockies. We need a nuclear weapons specialist. Of course. A nuclear weapons specialist has already been assigned           to us. We need backup from a specialist. I'm just an amateur when it comes           to nuclear weapons. I know. That's why I've requested the assistance of a military           analyst named Nastasha Romanenko. She'll be providing you backup           by Codec. A female analyst? She's built up an impressive record as an advisor to the Nuclear           Emergency Search Team. Contact her if you have any questions.           She's also an expert on hi-tech weapons. Where's she working from? At her home in Los Angeles. California. Seems like a million miles away. How well-armed are these terrorists? I know there was an exercise           going on at the time they revolted. They're heavily armed I'm afraid. What about they're battle experience. The six members of FOX-HOUND in charge are all hardened veterans.           They're tough enough to eat nails and ask for seconds. I wouldn't expect anything less from FOX-HOUND. The others are Next-Generation Special Forces. They're not your           average grunts either. Tell me about these Next-Generation Special Forces. They started out as an anti-terrorist special-ops unit made up of           members from former biochem units, technical escort units, and the           Nuclear Emergency Search Team. Their purpose was to respond to           threats involving next-generation weapons of mass destruction,           including NBC (nuclear/biological/chemica) weapons. Until "they" were added that is. Who's "they"? These guys didn't start out as regular army. Looks like a pretty international group. Mercenaries? Yeah. And it gets worse. Most of them were from a merc agency that I           think you're familiar with. They were part of Big Boss' private           guard. And after Big Boss went down, the military just bought out           all their contracts. Outer Heaven. After that they were merged with our own VR unit, Force 21, and           re-trained. If you ask me, these so-called "Next-Generation Special           Forces" should to be called "simulated soldiers." They have no           real battle experience. Video game players, huh? Don't forget they've all been strengthened with gene therapy. They           carry genes which make them excellent soldiers. Don't get careless           just because they don't have much experience. I thought using genetically modified soldiers was prohibited by           international law. Yes, but those are just declarations not actual treaties. The interesting thing is that nearly every member of the unit           conspired in this attack. How could an entire unit be subverted to rebellion? They're calling it a revolution. Since they all went through the same gene therapy, they probably           felt closer than brothers. They see the unit as their only family. The Sons of Big Boss. But if they were regular army, they must've           been interviewed periodically by army counsellers. According to their files, they all got straight A's on their           psychological tests. They all seemed like fine, upstanding           patriotic soldiers. But they all took part in the uprising? No. Several people didn't show up on the day of the exercise.           That's why there was a resupply of troops. Was there any sign recently that something might be wrong? There was a report a month ago that they were acting strangely. Apparently they consulted classified information about the soldier           genes and performed their own gene therapy experiments. They can do that even without you? Well our gene therapy process is almost completely automated. And           besides that they're all geniuses with IQs over 180. Even the existence of this genome army is a national secret of the           highest order. We'd been hoping to investigate this quietly and           deal with it behind closed doors. Hi-Tech special forces unit FOX-HOUND. Your former unit, and           one that I was a commander of. An elite group combining firepower           and expertise. They're every bit as good as when I was commanding           them. So they're still around. There are six members of FOX-HOUND involved in this terrorist           activity. Psycho Mantis, with his powerful psychic abilities. Sniper           Wolf, the beautiful and deadly sharpshooter. Decoy Octopus, master           of disguise. Vulcan Raven, giant and shaman. And Revolver Ocelot,           specialist in interrogation and a formidable gunfighter. Looks like a lovely bunch of folks. Too bad we'll be meeting under           these circumstances. And finally, in charge of them, FOX-HOUND's squad leader Liquid           Snake. Liquid Snake?! Yes and you're the only person who can stand against him. Liquid Snake. Liquid Snake. The man with the same codename as you. Tell me what you know. He fought in the Gulf War as a teenager, the youngest person in the           SAS (British Special Air Service).  His job was to track down and           destroy mobile SCUD missile launching platforms. You were there too           I believe. Didn't you infiltrate western Iraq with a platoon of           Green Berets? I was just a kid myself back then. The details are classified, but it seems that originally he           penetrated the the Middle East as a sleeper for the SIS. He was a spy for the British Secret Intelligence Service? But he never once showed his face in Century House. He was taken           prisoner in Iraq, and after that there was no trace of him for           several years. After you retired, he was rescued and became a member           of FOX-HOUND. I thought that by the time I left they were no longer using           codenames. I don't know his real name. That information is so highly classified           that even I can't look at it. Here's a photo of him.  Pretty           shocking, huh?  His skin tone is a little different but otherwise           you two are exact duplicates. I have a twin? I don't know the details, but it seems so. That's why we really need           you for this mission. You're the only one who can beat him. Now that I've met you, I know.           You've got something he doesn't. I can see it in your eyes. Why don't I find that thought more comforting? Colonel, I don't work for the government anymore. Let me go back to           Twin Lakes. Why Snake? Is your life in Alaska all that great? There's a dogsled race this week. Next Saturday I have to be in           Anchorage. The Iditarod? The longest sled race in the world? When did you           become a dog musher? Right now my fifty huskies are my only family. I've got to take care           of them. Don't worry about your dogs. What do you mean? I'm sorry Snake but this vessel is headed for the Bering Sea.           There's no room for debate. I told you, even if I do owe you I don't anything to this army or           this country! You will accept this assignment! Why should I be stupid enough to do that? I'm no patriot. Snake, there's enough dirt in your file from your days as an agent           to keep you in the stockade until you're a very old man. Oh I see. Blackmail. No Snake. I prefer to look at it as helping you to come to a           decision more easily. But anyway, I know you better than that. You'd           take this assignment even without the threat. Why do you say that? You're a natural born soldier. You're not the grow old gracefully           type. Same for all of us who've seen real action. The only place we           can feel truly alive is on the battlefield. I'm a solider too. I           know those feelings of powerlessness, frustration that you feel           everyday. You've tried to play the boy scout out there in Alaska,           but you can't race dogs in the snow forever.  Why don't you come           back to us and be a soldier again. You think my life is some kind of joke? Snake, I just want to give you back your purpose in life. Colonel, you're retired. Why are you involved in this? Becaue there aren't many people who know FOX-HOUND as well as I do. Is that really the only reason? I've been soldiering for a long time, I don't know anything else. I           guess even though I'm getting a little old, I still love to be in           the field. Colonel, you're a lousy liar. Tell me the real reason. Okay Snake. Sorry. I'll be frank. A person very dear to me is being           held hostage. Who is it? My neice. Meryl. What was your niece doing here? Several soldiers were reported missing the day of the revolt. And           my niece was one of those called in as an emergency replacement. She looks like you. She's my little brother's girl. He died in the Gulf War. Since then           I've been watching after her. A personal motive, Colonel. That's not very soldierly. I'm retired. I'm just an old man now. And I'm your friend. Since when are we friends? I've thought of us as friends since the fall of Zanzibar. With my personality I don't have too many friends. That's what I trust about you. It's what makes you human. Please           Snake. Save my niece Meryl. All right, but I have two conditions. Name them. One, no more secrets between us. I want complete disclosure at all           times and two, I'll only accept orders from you, Colonel. No cutoffs           involved okay? Agreed. That's why I was called. But one thing. What? I'm not a colonel anymore. Just a retired old warhorse. I understand, Colonel. That doctor. Is she part of this operation too? She was in charge of FOX-HOUND's gene therapy. She knows more about           those men than anyone else. You mean you've seen them naked? Make no mistake. I'm not a nurse. I'm a scientist. By the way, what was that injection for? It's a combination of and nanomachines and an anti-freezing peptide           so that your blood and other bodily fluids don't freeze, even at           sub-arctic temperatures. Nanomachines? Not just one kind either. There are different types which will           replenish the supply of adrenaline, nutrition and sugar in your           bloodstream. Now I don't have to worry about food. I also put some nootropics in there. Say what? Nootropics. It's a class of drugs which wil help improve your           mental functioning. It'll make smarter huh? Anything else? Benzedrine. It's a type of stimulant. It'll keep you alert and           responsive for twelve straight hours. That was quite a cocktail. Anything else in there? Those nanomachines will also keep your Codec's batteries charged up. I guess I can call you when I'm ready to go on a diet. You're welcome. I need to borrow your scissors. What are you going to do? Don't worry. Just going to clean myself up a little. Huh? I don't want to be mistaken for the leader of the terrorists.******************************************************************************                          5.2   Infiltration******************************************************************************(Snake swims through the lower dock of the disposal facility.  We seea man riding up the cargo elevator.) Stay alert!  He'll be through here, I know it.  I'm going to go           swat down a couple of bothersome flies.(Snake removes his flippers and calls Campbell on the codec.) This is Snake.  Colonel, can you hear me? Loud and clear Snake.  What's the situation? Looks like the elevator in the back is the only way up. Just as I expected.  You'll have to take the elevator to the           surface.  But make sure that nobody sees you.  If you need to           contact me by codec, the frequency is 140.85.  When you want to use           the codec push the Select button. When we need to contact you the           codec will beep.  When you hear that noise push the Select button.           The codec directly stimulates the small bones of your ear, no one           but you will be able to hear it. Got it, okay, I'm ready to go.(Snake takes off his scuba gear and watches the landscape slide by as the elevator ascends.  The title appears on the screen "Metal Gear Solid".  The elevator stops and Snake quickly runs out and looks for cover behind a storage crate.) It's Snake.  I'm in front of the disposal facility. Excellent, Snake.  Age hasn't slowed you down one bit. How's that Sneaking Suit working out? I'm nice and dry, but it is a little hard to move. Bear with it.  It's designed to prevent hypothermia.  This is           Alaska you know. Take it easy, I'm grateful.  If it wasn't for your suit and your           shot I would have turned into a popsicle out there. An anti-freezing peptide Snake.  All of the Genome soldiers in this           excercise are using it. I'm relieved to hear that.  Already tested, huh?  By the way, how's           the diversionary operation going? Two F-16s just took off from Galena and are headed your way.  The           terrorist's radar should have picked them up by now.(Snake peers out from behind the crate and sees a group of terroristsby a helicopter.) A Hind D?  Colonel, what's a Russian gunship doing here? I have no idea...but it looks like our little diversion got their           attention.  Now's your best chance to slip in unnoticed.(The helicopter takes off, throwing snow in all directions, the guardson the ground shield their eyes as they follow it up into the sky.) There are only 18 hours left until their deadline.  You've got to           hurry. Wow...you must be crazy to fly a Hind in this kind of           weather. Who's that? Oh sorry, I haven't introduced you two yet.  This is Mei Ling.  She           was assigned to us as our visual and data processing specialist.           She designed your codec, as well as your Soliton radar system.           Contact her if you have any questions about either of them. Nice to meet you Snake.  It's an honor to speak to a living legend           like yourself. ...... What's wrong? Nothing...I just didn't expect a world-class designer of military           technology to be so...cute. You're just flattering me... No, I'm serious.  Now I know I won't be bored for the next 18 hours. C'mon, I can't believe I'm being hit on by the famous Solid Snake...           But I'm surprised, you're very frank for a trained killer. Looks like we both have a lot to learn about each other. Yeah, I'm looking forward to meeting the man behind the legend...but           first, let me explain about your Soliton radar system. The bright dot in the middle is you Snake.  The red dots are your            enemies and the blue cone shape represents their field of vision. Be careful Snake. The Genome soldiers have highly developed senses           of hearing and vision due to their gene therapy.  Make sure you           don’t let them see you. First I want you to infiltrate the disposal site and look for the           DARPA Chief. The DARPA Chief was injected with the same GPS transmitting           nanomachines as you. He should appear on your radar as a green dot. Get whatever information you can from him about the terrorists.  If           he’s alive that is... Snake, your radar isn't affected by the weather, but if you're           discovered by an enemy you won't be able to use it. Yes, it gets jammed easily I'm afraid. Yes, it's all made from currently existing technology.  You won't be           able to use it in an area with strong harmonic resonance.  So be           careful. We'll be monitoring your movements by radar... so contact us by           Codec anytime  you want. Got it.  I'll call if I'm feeling lonely. Seriously Snake.  We're here to back you up, so call if you need           some information or advice. I'm also in charge of your mission data.  Contact me if you want me           to record your current status.  My frequency is 140.96.  It's a           dedicated frequency for saving data.  Don't forget it. Remember, except for your binoculars you're naked.  You need to arm           yourself with whatever weapons you can find. I remember.  First I'm strip searched by Doctor Naomi here, and then           all my weapons are taken away.  Imagine yourself put in that           position. Well, if yck in one you make it back in one peice, maybe I'll let           you do a strip search on me. I'll hold you to that doctor.  By the way, sorry to dissapoint you           but I did manage to smuggle out my smokes. How did you do that? In my stomach.  Thanks to the shot you gave me that suppressed my           stomach acids. Cigarettes?  How are those going to help you? You never know. If you want to get in, there's the front door.(Snake pulls out his binoculars and takes a look.) It's the fastest way, but there's too much risk of being spotted by           the enemy. I can't just knock on the door and ask them to let me in.  One           sentry on the left and one on the right.  They're armed with "five           five sixers" and pineapples...(As the guard on the right approaches Snake puts back his binocularsand hides behind the crate again.  Then he goes over to the left andpulls out his binoculars again.) What about the air duct near the door?(Snake locates the duct but it is guarded, he pans up to the upperlevel of the facility.) There should also be a duct on the second floor.(Snake looks across to the walkway on the second floor to find thevent but his view is blocked by the railing.) I can't see it from here.(Snake lowers his binoculars and once again hides behind the crate.) I'll let you decide the best COA.  I'm counting on youSnake.(The game resumes and the player takes control.  Eventually, Snakeenters the vent on the second floor of the facility, he gets a codeccall from Master Miller, his old instructor.) Snake, it's been a long time. Master?  What are you doing here? I quit being a drill instructor, so I moved out here for some           peace and quiet.  I'm in retirement just like you.  Once in a while           I still help train the Alaskan Scouts. Passing on the skills to a new generation, huh? Campbell told me about the situation here.  I thought I might be of           some use. There's no one I'd rather have in a foxhole than you. Well, I know lots about survival in a harsh environment.  I've lived           in Alaska longer than you, so call me if you have any questions           about the flora or fauna out here.  My frequency is 141.80.(Snake is moving through the vent shafts and he sees two Genome Soldiers talking through one of the vent covers.)I moved the DARPA Chief to the cell in the 1st floor basement. What about the vent shaft cleaning? They just opened the vent covers.  They're about to start spraying           for rats. 1st floor basement ventilation shaft... Shut those covers as soon as they're done spraying.  Also, keep           your eye on that woman in the cell.  Don't get careless now. Woman in the cell? Did something happen? There's an intruder. Really? He's already done three people. He's killed three people? Yeah.  They say he's using stealth too. Stealth? There's an intruder besides me? Anyway, I want you to increase the security detail on the chief.(Snake finds the DARPA chief in his cell and drops down through a ventopening.) Who... who, who's that? I'm here to save you.  You're the DARPA Chief, Donald Anderson,              right? You're here to save me, huh?  What's your outfit? I'm the pawn they sent here to save your worthless butt. Really?  It's true... You don't look like one of them.  In that              case, hurry up and get me out of here. Slow down.  Don't worry.  First I want some information... about              the terrorists. The terrorists? Do they really have the ability to launch a nuke? What are you talking about? The terrorists are threatening the White House.  They say if they              don't accede to their demands they'll launch a nuclear weapon. Sweet Jesus... Is it possible?! ... It's possible.  They... could launch a nuke.(The woman in the next cell here this bit of information and stops thesit-ups she was doing.) How do they plan to launch?  I though this place was just for              keeping the dismantled warheads.  THey shouldn't have access to              a missile... What I'm about to tell you is classified information. Okay?  We              were conducting excercises of a new type of experimental weapon.              A weapon that will change the world. What? A weapon with the ability to launch a nuclear attack from any              place on the face of the earth.  A nuclear equipped, walking              battle tank. Metal Gear!?  It can't be! ... You knew!?  Metal Gear is one of the most secret black              projects!  How did you know that? We've had a couple of run-ins in the past.  So that's the reason              you were here at this disposal site? Why else would I come to a God-forsaken place like this. I had heard the Metal Gear project was scrapped. On the contrary, it has grown into a huge joint project between              ArmsTech and ourselves.  We were going to use this exercise as              raw data and then proceed to mass production.  If it hadn't been              for the revolution. Revolution... ? Rex has fallen into the hands of terrorists. Rex?(A guard takes notice of the converstaion in the cell and slowly creepsto the door.) Metal Gear Rex, the codename for the new Metal Gear prototype.              They're probably already finished aiming the warhead they plan to              use with Rex.  These guys are pros.  They're all experienced in              handling and equipping weapons.(The guard bangs on the door.)  Hey! Sut up in there willya!(The DARPA chief waves him away, and Snake comes out from his hidingplace by the doorway.) But I thought that all nuclear watheads were equipped with safety              measures.  Some kind of detonation code that you have to input. Oh, you mean PAL.  Yes, of course, there is a PAL.  It's set up              so that you need to input two different passwords in order to              launch the device. There are two passwords? Yes.  Baker knows one and I know one. Baker?  The president of ArmsTech? That's right.  Each of us has to input our password or there can              be no launch.  But... they found out my password. You talked? Psycho Mantis can read people's minds.  You can't resist. Psycho Mantis? One of the members of FOX-HOUND.  He has psychic powers. ...This is bad... It's just a metter of time before they get Baker's too. If they find out Baker's password... Yes.  They'll be able to launch a nuke anytime.  But there is a              way to stop the launch. What? The card keys. They were designed by ArmsTech, the system developers as              an emergency override.  even without the passwords, you can just              insert the card keys and engage the safety lock. And if I do that? Yes.  You can stop the launch.(The woman in the next cell hears this.) That card key... ? So where are the keys? Baker should have them.  Listen.  You need three card keys. There              are three different slots to put them in.  You need to insert a              card into each one of them. Okay three card keys.  Do you know where they mught be keeping              Baker? Somewhere in the 2nd floor basement. 2nd floor basement? I heard the guard say they moved him to an area that has a lot of              electronic jamming. Any other clues? Yes... they cemented over the entrances but but didn't have              enough time to paint over them.  Why don't you look for the areas              where the walls are a different cover?(The DARPA chief gets up and fishes something out of his pocket.) Here, take this.  It's my ID card.  It'll open any level one              security door.  It's called a PAN card.  It works together with              your body's own electrical field. Personal Area Network, huh? It transmits data using the salts in your body as the              transmission medium.  As you approach the door's security devices              they'll read the data stored in the card. And the doors will open automatically, gotcha.  OK.  I'm going to              get you out of here. Wait a minute. What is it? You haven't heard of another way to disarm the PAL, have you?              From your bosses or anyone. No. Are you sure you haven't heard anything? I just said no. So, does the White House plan to give in to the terrorists              demands? That's their problem.  It has nothing to do with my orders. But... what about the Pentagon? Pentagon?(The DARPA chief grabs at his chest and starts to spasm.) Nnnnnnghhhhhh! What is it!? Ww... Why?  Uuuuuughhhh!(The woman in the cell hears the chief cry out and becomes alarmed.She starts to bang on the wall and the door.) What's that!?  Hey! What happened!?(After struggling a little bit longer the chief finally dies andslumps to the ground at Snake's feet.  The woman stops banging onthe door.  Snake reaches down to feel the chief's pulse, nothing.) Hmmmm... dead.(Snake calls the Colonel on the codec.) Naomi!  The chief! What happened? I... I don't know.  It looked like a heart attack but... A heart attack?  No... ...Colonel, are you hiding something from me? Absolutely not.  Snake, you've got to understand.  This op is              security level Red.  You need the highest security clearance to              get access to the complete file. You want me to believe that you are in charge of this op, but              you don't have access to the complete file!? I told you.  The Secretary of Defense is in operational control.              I'm just here as your support. ........ Snake, we don't have time to debate.  get out of there and find              President Baker!(The door to the woman's cell is opened and a struggle is heard.  Aftera moment it stops and somebody opens Snake's door.  He looks out andsees the guard naked on the floor, unconsious.  Snake is held up bysomebody disguised in an enemy uniform.  It is the woman from the cell.) Don't move!  So you killed the Chief.  You bastard!(Snake turns around to face the woman.) Liquid!?  No... you're not.(Snake makes a sudden movement, he startles the woman.) Don't move!(Her hands are shaking.  Snake notices this.) Is this the first time you've ever pointed a gun at a person?  Your           hands are shaking. !!!(Snake grabs the barrel of her gun and pull it to his chest.) Can you shoot me, rookie? Careful, I'm no rookie!! Liar!  That nervous glance... that scared look in your eyes. They're           rookie's eyes if I ever saw them.  You've never shot a person, am I           right? You talk too much. You haven't even taken the safety off, rookie. I told you I'm no rookie!!!(Enemy soldiers are waiting outside the door listening to this, waitingto come in.) You're not one of them are you?(One of the soldiers motions to the others to make thair move.  Theynod in agreement.) Open that door!  You've got a card don't you!? Why? So we can get the hell out of here.(The door opens and the guards rush in.) Looks like we'll be a little delayed.  What are you doing!?  Don't           think!  Shoot!(They battle the guards and defeat them.  The woman from the cell runsout of the room.) Thanks for the help.(She makes a bee-line for the elevator.  Snake is looking at her butt.) Wait! Who are you?(The scene changes.  We see three men standing in a small gropu aroundan unidentified body.) You fool!  You've killed him!! I'm sorry, Sir.(A third man speaks, his voice is distorted, as if speaking through agas-mask.) ...His mental shielding was very strong.  I could not dive             into his mind. Now we'll never get that detonation code... Boss, I have a good idea.(We are back in the cell area.  The woman runs into an elevator andturns around quickly.  She fires her gun at Snake, he dodges it easily.) Uuufff!!  Damn!!(The woman pumps her arm as the doors close.  Snake hears a noise, andthen sees somebody appear, floating in the air.  He sounds like thethird man from the last scene.) Good girl. Just like that...(The man dissapears just a abruptly as he came.  Snake is now veryconfused.  He calls up Naomi on the Codec.) Naomi, I just had some kind of hallucination.  Is it from the           nanomachines? No Snake.  The nanomachines are funtioning properly. So what was it? It must have been psychometric interferance coming from Psycho           Mantis.  FOX-HOUND's psychic.  Think of it as a mental feedback           loop. So that was Mantis...?(Snake finds President Baker tied to a concrete support beam on levelB2.  He walks over to him.) Am I too late? Oooooo.....  Huhuuhuhuh..... He's alive.  You're the ArmsTech president Kenneth Baker, right?           Don't worry, I'm here to save you.(Snake reaches out to touch the old man.) Noooo!  Don't touch it...(Snake retracts his hand quickly as he sees C4 attached to wiressurrounding the president.) C4!(A gun is cocked somewhere in the back of the room and a shot is fired.Snake jumps up into the air and the bullet ricochets off the floor.) Right.  Touch that wire and the C4 will blow up along with the           old man!  So you're the one the Boss keeps talking about. And you? Special Operations FOX-HOUND.(The man twirls a revolver in his hand.) Revolver Ocelot.  I've been waitng for you, Solid Snake.  Now we'll           see if the man can live up to the legend!(Ocelot rubs his gun slowly for Snake to see.) This is the greatest handgun ever made.  The Colt Single Action           Army.(Ocelot loads his gun.) Six bullets.  More than enough to kill anything that moves. Now I'll           show you why they call me... "Revolver".(Snake crouches, ready to whip out his gun, Ocelot does the same.) Draw!******************************************************************************                  5.3   "I'm like you... I have no name"******************************************************************************(They fight and after a few rounds are fired Ocelot pauses to reload his gun.) Just what I'd expect from the man with the same code as the boss.           It's been a long time since I've had such a good fight but I'm just           getting warmed up.(Ocelot leaps out from behind the pillar ready to shoot but a cloaked figure jumps down from the ceiling and attacks him with a sword.  Ocelot's arm is cut off in the forearm.) What!  My hand!!!(The figure quickly slices down all of the wires connected to the C4 andthe ropes binding Baker to the support pillar.  he falls to the groundas the C4 explodes around him.  Ocelot is thrown against the wall bythe explosions.) Aaaaaaahhh!! Uuuunnhh!  Ooooof!  Stealth Camouflage, can't you even die right!?           You were lucky, we'll meet again!(Ocelot runs out of the chamber as the figure reveals himself.  He isdecked out as a cyborg ninja.  Snake levels his gun at him.) Who are you!? I'm like you... I have no name. Ohhh... ohhhh!  That... that exoskeleton...!(The ninja ignores Baker and turns around to face Snake.  After a shorttime of staring each other down the ninja begins to convulse.) Ggggyyyaaaaaaahhh!!!  Ggggyyyyaaaaaaaahhh!!!           Gggggyyyyyaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!(The ninja stops convulsing and hurries out of the room, jumping about.Snake holsters his weapon.) Who the hell!?(Snake helps Baker up to his feet.) Can you talk? Who are you? I'm not one of them.  The DARPA Chief told me he gave them his           detonation code.  What about yours? Oh, I get it.  Jim sent you... You... you're from the Pentagon. Answer my question!  What about your code!?  There's no time! I... talked. What! Now the terrorists have both codes and can launch anytime! It's not like I didn't fight.  I managed to resist Psycho Mantis's           mind probe. He couldn't read you?  How'd you do it? Surgical implants in my brain. Surgical implants? Kind of like a psychic insulation.  Everybody who knows these           top-secret codes has it. Even the DARPA Chief? Of course. But the DARPA Chief said Mantis got his code by reading his mind. Are you sure you heard him right? Yeah, I'm sure.  In that case, how did they get your code? I never had any training on how to resist torture...(Baker coughs violently, he is obviously in very bad shape.) It looks like he had some fun with you all right. He's not human.  I tell you, he loved every second of it. What happened to your arm? He broke it. Looks like you're more than even now.  His was sliced off. Ha. You're a funny man.  ...So... the DARPA Chief... is he okay? Dead. What!?  It can't be!  You know that's not what you promised, Jim!           Now you want to shut me up!(Baker begins to whack Snake's leg with his cane.  Snake quickly calmshim down.) Calm down!  What's wrong with you?  I just told you I was here to           save you!  I didn't kill the DARPA Chief.  He had a heart attack or           something. A heart attack? Oh, don't be a fool. Anyway, the terrorists have both codes now. Those boys are totally insane.  They wouldn't hesitate to launch. I agree.  But what do they really want? Who knows.  Maybe they're like us in the arms industry... always           looking forward to the next good war. Well I'm not going to let these maniacs start a war toady.  Do you           still have the card keys. Card keys? To override tge detonation codes!  I heard you had them... No, not anymore. What!?  Who does then!?  Not the terrorists!? No, that woman. Woman!?  Who!? A soldier that was thrown in prison along with me. A female soldier?  It must be... She said that she had just joined up as a new recruit.  She said           they threw her in prison because she refused to take part in the           rebellion. A new recruit?  Could that be the Colonel's niece!? I gave her the key.  Looks like she managed to break out of here           though. I hope she's okay. I'm sure she is.  She's green... but as tough as they come.  But           how did you know she escaped? I was in contact with her by Codec.  Until I was tied up here           that is. Codec? Yes.  She stole it from the guard.  If she still has it, you           should be able to contact her. I'm sure she still has it.  What frequency was she at? Oh yeah.  Let me tell you.  It's...(Baker is struggling to remember.) Huh? ...Oh... sorry... I forgot... Damn! Oh that's right!  It should be on the back of the CD case.  Try to           contact her. I'll contact her right away.  But tell me... If this doesn't work,           is there some other way to prevent the missile launch? Hmmm.  You need to find Hal Emmerich, one of my employees. Who's that? The team leader of the Metal Gear Rex project.  A genius at           engineering, but a little bit of an oddball.  If there is anyone who           can figure out how to stop Metal Gear from launching, it's him. What if he can't come up with anything? You'll have to destroy it.  Emmerich knows how to destroy Metal           Gear. Where is this Emmerich? Well... he's probably being held somewhere in the Nuclear Warhead           Storage Building.  It's north from here.  That's where he worked. I understand, but... why Metal Gear?  The Nuclear Age ended with the           turn of the millenium. You're wrong.  The threat of nuclear war isn't gone... in fact           it's greater than it's ever been.(Scenes of missile launches, storage buildings, and missile silos areshown.) The amount of spent nuclear fuel and plutonium is increasing even           today.  Listen, have you ever seen a warehouse full of nuclear           material? ...No. Drums and drums of nuclear waste stacked this high.  As far as           you can see because there's still no real way to dispose of the           stuff. So they just close the lid and pretend like it'll go away? Essentially, yes.  And they're not even doing a good job of storing           it.  Many of the drums are corroded... with nuclear waste seeping           out of them. Unbelievable. Not only that, several pounds of MUF are reported every year. MUF? It stands for "material unnacounted for". It proves that there           is a large and well organized black market in nuclear materials.           Furthermore, since the end of the Cold War, Russian nuclear           engineers, in particular, are out of work with nowhere to turn.(We go back to the chamber where Snake and Baker are conversing.) In other words, there is plenty of nuclear material and scientists           for making a bomb.  We live in an age when any small country can           have a nuclear weapons program. What about the other superpowers? Russia and China still maintain a signifigant nuclear presence.           Complete nuclear disarmament is an impossibility.  To maintain our           own policy of deterrance, we need a weapon of overwhelming power. You mean Metal Gear. You know our industry suffered quite a blow as a result of the           cut-backs in military budgets, due to this so called "peace". I remember hearing a lot about mergers and take-overs among the           big weapons makers. Yes.  And after my company lost their bid to produce the Air Force's           next fighter jet, the Metal Gear project was out last ace in the           hole.  That's why we pushed to have Metal Gear developed as a           black project. Black project? Secret projects paid for by the Pentagon's black budget.  You can           avoid a lot of red tape a get a great lead-time on your weapons           production.  And no one can bother you.  Not even those bleeding           heart liberals on the military oversight committee. Bribes. I prefer to think of it as good buisness.  Anyway, Metal Gear was           going to be formally adopted after the results of this exercise           were analyzed. I don't give a crap about you and your company. Yes, that's about what I'd expect from a grunt like you... Here,           this is what you came for, right?(Baker fishes a disc out of his pocket and hands it to Snake.) What's that? An optical disk.  It's all here.  The main hard drive was destroyed           by gunfire.  This is the only remaining copy of the data. What kind of data? All the data collected from this exercise.  Don't play dumb.  I           know you were sent to get this.  I hid it from that sadistic maniac           while he was torturing me.  They don't know that this disk exists.           Make sure that you report this to Jim... to your boss.  I'll give           you my card too.  It'll open up all level two security doors. Can you walk? ...No ...You go on without me.  They got my password... they don't           want anything else from me. I have one more question.  Who or what was that ninja thing?  It           looked like you knew something. That ninja?  That was FOX-HOUND's dark little secret. Dark little secret? An experimantal... genome... soldier...(Baker coughs once more.) You know him? You should ask Dr. Naomi Hunter from FOX-HOUND.  She knows better           than I. Naomi? You've got to stop them.  If it goes public, my company and I are...           finished. What?  Doesn't Metal Gear use currently existing technology? Metal Gear itself does, but...(Baker bends over in pain.) Huh!? What... what did you do to me!?  Uh... oooh...no!  ...Ooh.  Oh no,           it can't be! ...those Pentagon bastards!  ...So they...they actually           went ahead and did it! What are you talking about!? They... they're just... using you for... uuuhhh...(Baker slumps over and Snake stands in front of him stunned andconfused.) What the hell?(After thinking for a moment he calls Campbell on the Codec.) Colonel!  Are you listening?  Now he's dead too! ...I have no idea! Don't lie to me! It looked like another heart attcak but... Some kind of poison!? Well, there are a lot of drugs that can cause a heart attack in           large doses.  For example. potassium chloride or dioxides... But...           we won't be able to tell without doing an autopsy. Damn! Snake, I want you and Meryl to work together! Can I trust her? ...More than you can trust me. ...... Get in contact with her. Snake, there is a lot of electrical interferance coming from there.           It should be okay if you do burst transmission like us but normal           transmission is probably impossible.  Try moving away from that           area. Snake, get a hold of yourself. Naomi, what the hell was that ninja thing? ..... A member of FOX-HOUND? No... Are you sure? Yes, we have no one like that in our unit. Is that right? Snake, I'm counting on you.(The transmission ends and Snake is left to find Meryl's Codecfrequency.  He does find it on the back of the CD case and contacts her.) Who are you? I was really impressed with the way you busted yourself out of           there. The one from the prison? You're the Colonel's niece, Meryl, right? ....No... it's not him... Just exactly who are you? I'm the fool that your uncle sent all alone into the middle of this           whole mess. You came by yourself?  You think you're some kind of one-man army?           You're not even armed. I appreciate your help from before.  But... I don't need lectures.           You're just like your uncle, you know. How do you know my uncle? We go way back. What's your name? My name's not important. Aha!  Could you be Snake?  Are you Solid Snake? That's what some people called me. The legendary Solid Snake...!  You!?  Sorry about before.  I wasn't           sure if you were one of the good guys. But I knew you were. How? It's your eyes. My eyes? They're not soldiers eyes. They're rookie's eyes, right? No, they're beautiful compassionate eyes. Just what I'd expect from the legendary Solid Snake.  You trying           to sweep me off my feet? Don't worry.  You'll land back on them once you meet me.  The           reality is no match for the legend, I'm afraid. I don't believe that. Why did you look surprised when you saw my face? Because you look just like him. ...You mean the terrorists leader, Liquid Snake? Yeah, you know him?  You're not brothers are you!? I have no family. So, what's the deal then? Who knows.  Why don't you ask him?  But first I want some           information.  You were involved in this excercise from the           beginning. What exactly happened here? I'm sorry.  I was captured along with President Baker right after           the terrorist attack. That's okay.  But what is this place?  I don't think it is just a           nuclear wepaons disposal facility... Boy oh boy... it's just like them!  Nobody told you anything, did           they?  Okay... you see, this place isn't really for disposing           nuclear weapons.  This base is owned and operated by a dummy           corporation of ArmsTech. This is a civilian base? Right.  For the development of Metal Gear. Colonel! FOX-HOUND and the Next-Generation Special Forces were called           here for the test launching of a dummy nuclear warhead. Why FOX-HOUND? Because they're a Special Ops group used to handling top secret           missions.  They figured they could keep it all hush-hush. But we must have fired nuclear warheads before.  Why just this time? I heard it was because this was to be a final test before the formal           adoption of the Metal Gear program... that's what I heard anyway. Hmmm... sounds kind of fishy...  So what do you think the terrorists           want? Sorry, I'm not sure.  I was captured with President Baker right           after the revolt started. Oh yeah, that's when he gave you the detonation override keys,           right? That's right. Amazing you were able to keep 'em hidden from the guards. Well... women have more hiding places than men.  Anyway, you met           up with Baker, huh?  How's he holding up? He's dead... What!? Heart attack.  Same as the DARPA Chief. The Chief died from a heart attck too? Yeah, was either of them sick or anything? No, not that I heard of. Well, I don't believe in coincidences.  Something funny's going on. Hmmm.  Sounds like it. But I have no idea what. Me neither... yet.  Do you know the person who designed Metal Gear? You mean Dr. emmerich? Yes.  Is he still alive? Probably.  he should be in the second floor basemant of the Nuclear           Warhead Storage Building to the north. Second floor basement? Yeah, that's where his lab is.  I think they're forcing him to work           on the nuclear launching program. So they'll need him alive until that's done anyway. Then we'd better do something before he finishes. You're right.  In case we can't override the detonation code in time, I           need to ask him how to destroy Metal Gear. You plan to take that thing on by yourself, Snake? It won't be the first time... ......... What's the best way to get to the building where the Doctor is being           held? There's a cargo door on the first floor of this building that           leads to the north. What's the security level of the door there? Five, but it's okay... I've got a level five card. Well, I've got to go save the Doctor.  You should go... I'm going with you! No way!  You're still too green.  I want you to hide somewhere. I'm not green. Oh yes you are. .......... You pause for just one second in front of your enemy and it's           all over!  Good luck doesn't last forever! I don't know what happened.  I just couldn't pull the trigger           right away.  I never had any problems in training... But when I thought           about my bullets tearing through those soldiers' bodies, I hesitated. Shooting at targets and shooting at living, breathing people           are different. Ever since I was a little girl, I always dreamed of being a           soldier.  Every day of my life, I've trained my mind and my body for           the one day when I could finally see some real action, and now So what now?  You wanna quit? I can't quit.  I can't alow myself to quit now. Listen, Meryl.  Everybody feels sick the first time they kill           someone.  Unfortunately, killing is one of those things that gets           easier the more you do it.  In a war, all of mankind's worst emotions,           worst traits come out. It's easy to forget what a sin is in the middle           of a battlefield. But this isn't a war.  It's a terrorist action. You're just a little jumpy from the combat high.  The adrenaline           in your blood is starting to whin out.  Just take it easy. But I learned all about combat high at the academy... We'll talk about it later.  For now, just think about keeping           yourself alive. If I get out of here alive, I'll think about that other stuff. Okay, let me try to say this another way... Stay the hell out of my way. You're a real bastard, just like my uncle said. Ha ha, I told you.  The real me is no match for the legend. It looks like you were right.  Okay Snake, I'll be a good girl. We'll link up after I grab the Doctor.  Then we'll take care of the           detonation code override. Got ya.  But listen, I know this area better than you.  Call me if you           have any questions. Be careful, okay? After I open up the cargo door, I'll contact you.(Snake signs off and waits for Meryl to open the door.  When she does she calls him on the codec.) Snake, I unlocked the cargo door for you. Thanks.  Where are you? Where I can see ya. Don't move around too much. Don't worry, I'm disguised in this enemy uniform. You won't be for long with the way you walk. What does that mean? Oh... nothing. Listen Snake, the cargo door is like an airlock.  It's equipped           with infrared sensors.  Be careful.  If an intruder is sensed, gas is           released. Gas... Okay, so we'll meet at the Nuclear Warhead Storage Building. Wait!  You said you'd stay put and be a good girl! I changed my mind. Don't get careless.  That is when things always turn sour. Sorry, but this is the only way I can figure out whether or not           I'm cut out to be a soldier... I gotta get my hands dirty. These guys are proffesionals.  You're gonna get yourself killed. See ya there!(The cargo door opens and Snake passes the infrared sensors easily by using his cigarettes to see the beams.  Once on the other side of the door he is contacted by an unknown person on the Codec.) Snake, be careful!  There are Claymore mines around there. Use a             mine detector. Who are you? Just call me "Deepthroat". Deepthroat?  The informant from the Watergate scandal? Never mind about that. You're not using burst transmission.  Are you nearby? Listen.  There's a tank in front of your position waiting to             ambush you. Who are you anyway? One of your fans.(Deepthroat signs off and now Snake proceeds through the canyon ahead of him using the mine detector he picked up.  When he is about halfway through a tank rolls out of a door at the other end and rolls towards him.  A man speaks from within the tank.) This is Raven's territory...(The man who is speaking pops out the hatch of the tank and grabs the turret mounted machine-gun on top.) Snakes don't belomg in Alaska, I will not let you pass.  Send him a          message!(The tank fires a shell at Snake.  He does a quick backflip and dodges it by moving backwards through the air.  He lands hard in the snow.) Ha ha ha ha ha... That's right, you belong on the ground.  You          should crawl on the ground like the Snake you are.(Raven jumps back into the tank.) Come.  Let's fight!(Snake battles the tank and defeats it.  The tank blows up and a Genome Soldier is thrown violently out of the tank, he lands on the ground dead.  Snake walks over to him and fishes around inside his pockets for something.  He finds it and walks over to the door the tank came out of.) Well, Boss.  I hope you are happy.  He got the card. ...We'll play with him a little longer... You would be wise not to underestimate him. What did you think of him? He is just as you said.  In battle he is as if possessed by a               demon.  Much like you.  I would expect no less.(Now Ocelot comes on the radio.) You see?  I told you so.  But I will kill him. So, General Ivan, I hear he took your hand as well as your               dignity. Watch your toungue, Shaman! In the language of the Sioux people, "Sioux" means snake.  It               is known as an animal to be feared. Well, Snake is mine now...  When I meet him next, I'll take               special care of him. Not yet... Don't kill him yet... He and I will meet again in battle. Same prediction as always? Yes.  The raven on my head... it thirsts for his blood.(Snake is now inside the Nuclear Weapons Storage Building.  Campbellcalls on the Codec.) Be careful.  You absolutely must not use weapons in that area. I've already programmed the nanomachines so that he won't be able           to, Colonel. What?  What are you talking about? Have you forgotten?  That's where they keep the nuclear warheads.           Can't you see them? Yeah.  There's lots of boxes piled up here, but... are they all           warheads? Yes.  They're all dismantled warheads. They just leave them here?  It's like President Baker said...           totally careless. They're working on a limited budget.  They try to put on a pretty           face for the media, but this is the grim reality of it.  Nastasha           knows lots more than I do.  Her frequency is 141.52. All of the warheads in those boxes have had their detonation           mechanisms removed so there's no fear of them exploding.  But is           the warheads are broken they might leak plutonium and that would           be a serious problem. Snake, you must never use your weapon on that floor.(Snake gets through the level with no trouble but when he gets to the lower level of the building he comes across a room with many different hazards.  Once again Deepthroat calls.) Snake!  Watch out!  That place is filled with gas.  Also, the             floor is electrified.  First destroy the high voltage switch. Its             the switchboard on the northwest wall. But how?  I can't reach it. Use a remote-controlled missile.(Snake finds a remote-controlled missile and destroys the switch.  He then goes down the corridor and into a room where there is no gas.  He hears noises of people being attacked.  Gunfire and screaming is heard. He goes into the next corridor and meets a gruesome scene.  The corridor is filled with slaughtered guards.  There is blood everywhere, on the floors, walls, and even on the ceiling.) It looks like they were cut by some type of blade.(Snake then sees a guard stumble out from behind a corner. He is bleeding profusely.) It's... it's a ghost!  Uuurgh!(The guard falls to the ground.  Snake rounds the corner and hears more gunfire.  He then sees a guard being held up in the air by some invisible figure.  It is the ninja.  He slices the guards back and then goes inside a door, taking no notice of Snake.  Snake follows him.)(Snake enters the lab and sees the ninja with his stealth camouflage on.  He is following a small, wirey scientist who is backing away into a corner.  The scientist is so scared that he wets his pants.) Stealth camouflage?  Who are you?(The ninja turns off the stealth.) Where is my friend? What... what are you talking about?(The scientist sees Snake approaching.) What next?(The ninja turns around slowly to face Snake.) Snake!! You're that ninja. I've been waiting for you, Snake. Who are you? Neither enemy nor friend.  I am back from a world where such            words are meaningless. I've removed all obstacles.  Now you and I            will battle to the death. What do you want? I've waited a long time for this day.  Now I wanto to enjoy the            moment. What... what's with these guys? It's like one of my Japanese            animes... I've come from another world to do battle with you. What is it? Revenge? It is nothing so trivial as revenge.  A fight to the death with            you.  Only in that can my soul find respite.  I will kill you or            you will kill me... it makes no difference.(Slowly the scientist gets up. He is carefully watching the two talk in case they were to see him.  He quickly runs to a locker and shuts the door before either Snake or the Ninja can stop him.) Waaaaaaaaahhhhhh! Hah! Fine!  He can watch from inside there. I need that man.  Keep your hands off him. Now Snake.  Make me feel alive again.(The ninja brandishes his sword at Snake and they battle.  After fighting for a while they pause.  The ninja is kneeling on the ground.) I felt that, Snake... Do you remember me now? It can't be!  You were killed in Zanzibar...(Just like he did before the ninja convulses.) Eeeeeyaaaaaah! What!?  Not again!! The... the mediciiiiine!(The ninja falls to the ground at Snake's feet and begins to bang his head on the ground.) What's happening? ...I...I... I'm losing myself... Is it over? Waaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!!(The ninja runs out of the room quickly and leaves Snake behind.  Snakequickly calls the Colonel.) Grey Fox... Colonel, that ninja is Grey Fox.  No doubt about it. Rediculous!  You of all people should know he died in Zanzibar. No, he should have died... but he didn't. What!? It happened before I joined FOX-HOUND's medical staff.  They were           using a soldier for their gene therapy experiments. I never heard that. It happened right after you retired.  My predecessor, Dr. Clark,           was in charge. Dr. Clark... Yes.  He started the gene therapy project. And where is he now? He was killed in an explosion in his lab two years ago. And what about this soldier? Apparently for their test subject, they decided to use the body           of a soldier who was recovered after the fall of Zanzibar... And that was Grey Fox... But he was already dead... Yes.  But they revived him.  They fitted him with a prototype           exoskeleton and kept him drugged for four years while they           experimented on him like a plaything.  Today's genome soldiers were           born from those experiments. That's the sickest thing I ever heard. They used him to test all sorts of gene therapy techniques. Naomi, why didn't you tell us about this sooner? Because it's confidential information. Is that the only reason? ... Naomi: What happened to Grey Fox after that? The record says he died in the explosion. I see... But even if that ninja is Grey Fox, the question is why? From what I could tell, he didn't know who he was. Are you saying that he's just a mindless robot? I'm not sure, but he seems intent on fighting me to the death.           We'll meet again, I know it. So you'll fight again?  Until you kill him? Hmmmmm... I'd rather not, but maybe that's what he wants... ....(Snake signs off and approaches the locker where the scientist is hiding.) How long are you going to stay in there? Huh?  ...are you one of them? No, I'm not.  I always work alone. Alone?  Are you an Otaku too? C'mon, get out.  We can't stay here forver.(The scientist finally opens the locker and looks at Snake.) Your uniform is different from theirs. You're the Metal Gear shief engineer, Hal Emmerich, right? You know me? I heard about you from Meryl. Oh.  So you're here to rescue me? Sorry, but no.  There's something that I've got to do first. Oh, well... at least you're not one of them...(Emmerich begins to walk across the room, but he is limping badly.) Huh?  Are you hurt? I'm okay.  I just twisted my ankle a little bit trying to get            away. Well, if that's all, it's nothing to worry about. I want to ask            you something.  I need information about Metal Gear. Huh?  Metal Gear? Yeah.  What's Metal Gear really designed for? It's a mobile TMD.  It's designed to shoot down nuclear missiles,            only for defensive purposes of course.(Snake grabs Emmerich by the collar and holds him up, shaking him.) Liar!  I already know that Metal Gear is nothing more than a            nuclear-equipped, walking death mobile. Nuclear?  What are you talking about? The terrorists are planning to use Metal Gear to launch a            nuclear missile. You telling me I didn't know? They're going to put a nuclear missile into Metal Gear's           TMD missile module? Wrong.  From the beginning, the purpose of this exercise was to            test Metal Gear's nuclear launch capability using a dummy nuclear            warhead.  The terrorists are just continuing the work you started.(Snake throws Dr. Emmerich away from him.) No, you're wrong.... I heard it directly from your boss, Baker. No... a nuclear missile on Rex? ...So you really didn't know? No. All the armamnet was built by a seperate department and            the president personally supervised the final assembly of the            main unit. President Baker? Yeah.  I was never told exactly what they armed Rex with.            I...I only know it's equipped with a vulcan cannon, laser, and a            rail gun.(Scenes of Metal Gear Rex are shown on screen.) A rail gun you said? Yeah.  It uses magnets to fire bullets at extremely high            velocities.  The technology was originally developed for the SDI            system and later scrapped.  We were successful in miniaturizing it            in a joint venture between ArmsTech and Rivermore National Labs.            The rail gun is on Rex's right arm. Metal Gear's main funtion is to launch nuclear missiles.  You're            sure you're not forgetting something? It's true that Metal Gear has a missile module on his back            that can carry up to eight missiles.  But are you saying it was            originally meant to carry nuclear missiles?(We are now back in the lab where Otacon and Snake are talking.) Yeah, but that's not all I think.  If Metal Gear fired only            standard nuclear missiles, then they should already have all the            practical data they need. No... could it be?(Scenes of nuclear weapons exploding are shown.) Metal Gear's co-developer, Rvermore National Labs, was working on            a new type of nuclear weapon.  They were using NOVA and NIF laser            nuclear fusion testing equipment and supercomputers. So they developed a new type of nuclear weapon in a VR testing lab,            huh? Yes, but, you can't use virtual data on a battlefield.  They would            need actual launch data.(We are back in the lab.  Emmerich shows Snake some of the supercomputers used to do the testing) These are some of the supercomputers.  If you link these you can            test everything in a virtual environment.  But it's all just theoretical. So this exercise was designed to test the real thing? What did our president do?  If the terrorists launch that thing...            Damn!! ...Damn!!(Emmerich is on the ground now banging his fist against it.) I'm such a fool!  It's all my fault...(Scenes from the Hiroshima bomb are shown.) The truth is... my grandfather was part of the Manhattan Project.            He suffered with the guilt for the rest of his life.  And my            father... he was born on August 6, 1945... The day of the Hiroshima bomb... God's got a sense of humour all            right. Three generations of Emmeich men... We must have the curse of            nuclear weapons written into our DNA.(Back in the lab) I used to think I could use science to help mankind. But the one            that wound up getting used was me.  Using science to help mankind.            that's just in the movies... That's enough crying.  Pull yourself together!  Where is Metal            Gear?  Where on this base are they keeping it?(Rex is shown.) Rex is in the underground maintainence base. Where is that? North of the Communications Tower.  But it's a long way there. The emergency override system for the detonation code is there            too? Yeah, in the maintenance base's Control Room.  You better hurry.            If they were planning a launch from the start, then their            ballistic program is probably finished.  And since they haven't            called for me in a few hours, they must not need me.  In other            words, they must be ready to launch. Meryl's got the detonation override keys.  We'll link up with her. If we can't override the launch we'll have to destroy Rex.(Back in the lab.) I'll show you the way.(Emmerich makes to walk away but Snake stops him.) On that leg of yours?  You'll just slow me down. You'll need me if you're gonna destroy Rex. I don't need you.  I just need your brain. I created Rex. It's my right... my duty to destroy him. If you get a chance, try to escape.  When the coast is clear I'll            try to contact you by Codec. How am I supposed to escape from an island? Okay. So what then? I want you to hide somewhere and keep me informed.  You know this            place well, don't you? Of course I do.  And don't worry.  I've got this.(Emmerich reaches up to his shoulder and activates his stealth camouflage.) It's the same stealth technology as the ninja.  FOX-HOUND was            going to use them, but... With this I'll be fine, bad leg and all. Good.  But I want Meryl to watch after you too.(Snake kneels down and calls Meryl on the Codec.) Meryl, the engineer's okay. That's a relief. I want you to look after him.  Where are you now? Very close.(Someone is shouting in the background.) There she is!  Over there! Oh no!  Damn... they've spotted me!! Meryl!  What happened!?(Snake signs off the codec quickly after Meryl goes offline.) Something's wrong. Did you hear something?  Wasn't that some kind of music? What did she look like? She... she was wearing the same green uniform as the terrorists.(Flashbacks to when Meryl excaped from the prison.) A disguise? She had such a cute way of walking.  She kind of wiggles her behind. You were really looking. Well... she's got a very cute behind... Way of walking, huh? If she's disguised as the enemy, you'll have to contact her when            she's alone, huh?  There's only one place where we can be sure            she's by herself. Where's that? Don't be so dense...(Emmerich pulls something out of his lab coat and hands it to Snake.) Here, use this security card.  It's security level 4. You're not in pain, are you? Huh? You feel okay?  Nothing bothering you? What's wrong?  Getting all fiendly all of a sudden? Oh nothing.... I'm glad you're okay. You're strange. I'm a little nervous.  Everyone else I've saved suddenly dies. You're bad luck. Forget it, Doctor. Call me, Otacon. Otacon? It stands for Otaku Convention.  An Otaku is a guy like me who            likes Japanimation.(Japanese anime clips are shown.) Japan was the first country to successfully make bipedal robots.            They're still the best today in the field of robotics. And Japanese cartoons played some part in that? They did.  I didn't get into science to make nuclear weapons, you            know. That's what all scientists say. I became a scientist because I wanted to make robots like the ones            in the Japanese Animes.  Really, it's true. Just sounds like a childish excuse to me. You're right.  We have to take responsibility.  Science has always            thrived on war.  The greatest weapons of mass destruction were            created by scientists who wanted to be famous.  But that's all            over now.  I won't take part in murder anymore. Whatever.  All I want from you is information. Sure.  I know everything about this whole base.  About this base            or Rex.  Also, with this stealth camouflage, I can sneak in and            out of the armory and mess hall.  If you need ammo or rations,            just tell me and I'll bring them to you.(Otacon turns on his stealth camouflage.) I'm on frequency 141.12.  See ya later.(Otacon exits the lab, leaving Snake behind.  Snake heads off to find Meryl. He does and meets her in the women's bathroom in the Nuclear Warhead Storage Building.)******************************************************************************                           5.4   Life and Death****************************************************************************** That's the second time I've been able to sneak up on the legendary            Solid Snake.(Meryl has her rifle pressed against Snake's back, unmenacingly.  Snake turns around to look at her.) You're Meryl?  There's no way you could pass for a man for long. What do you mean?  Hey!  Men aren't allowed in here. I had no idea you were so feminine. This is no time to try and hit on me, Snake.  Besides, it's a            waste of time.  When I joined up they gave me psychotherapy to            destroy my interest in men. Same smart mouth.  You're Meryl all right.  Are you hurt? Not yet.  After all, I was disguised as a Genome Soldier. So why'd you change?  You'd be better off dressed like one of them. I got tired of disguising myself.  The truth is... the uniform            smelled like blood.(Snake sees Meryl's tattoo on her left arm.) What's that mark? Huh?  Oh, this?  It's a paint tattoo.  It's not real.  I was a            fan of FOX-HOUND way back.  When guys like you and my uncle were            in it.  None of that gene therapy like there is today.  You guys            were real heroes. There are no heroes in war.  All the heroes I know are either            dead... or in prison.  One or the other. But Snake.  You're a hero.  Aren't you? I'm just a man who's good at what he does.  Killing.  There's no            winning or losing for a mercenary.  The only winners in war are            the people. That's right.  And you fight for the people. I've never fought for anyone but myself. I've got no purpose in            life.  No ultimate goal. Come on. It's only when I'm cheating death on the battlefield.  The only            time I feel truly alive. Seeing other people die makes you feel alive, huh?  You love war            and don't want it to stop... Is it the same with all great            soldiers throughout history? Why didn't you contact me? My Codec was broken. Is that all? Shouldn't you just be happy that we met up like this!?  How did            you recognize me in disguise? I never forget a lady. So there's something you like about me, huh? Yeah, you've got a great butt. Oh, I see.  First it's my eyes, now it's my butt.  What's next? On the battlefield you never think about what's next. So Snake... how are the negotiations doing? No progress. So, it's all up to you, huh? Somebody's got to prevent them from launching a nuclear missile. There are two ways.  Either we destroy Metal Gear, or... ...we override the detonation code.  You got the card keys from            Baker? Card keys?(Meryl reaches into her shirt and pulls out a card key.) You mean this? Where are the others?  There should be three keys. This is all I've got. Where could the other two be? I have no idea, but they must be somewhere.  If we can't find them            we'll have no choice but to destroy Metal Gear. Metal Gear is in an underground maintenance base to the north. Take me too.  I know this place better than you do. You'll just slow me down.  You don't have enough battle experience. I won't slow you down.  I promise. And what if you do? Then you can shoot me. I don't like to waste bullets. Got it.  I'll be careful.  Y'know... I don't use makeup the way            other women do... I hardly ever look at myself in the mirror. I've            always despised that kind of woman.  I always dreamed of becoming            a soldier.  But I was wrong.  It wasn't really my dream.  My            father... he was killed in action when I was younger. You wanted to follow in your father's footsteps? Not really.  I thought that if I became a soldier I could            understand him better. So are you a soldier yet? I thought I was until today.  But... now I understand.  The truth            is I was just afraid of looking at myself.  Afraid of having to            make my own decisions in life.  But I'm not going to lie to myself            any more.  It's time I took a long, hard look at myself... I want            to know who I am, what I'm capable of.  I want to know why I've            lived the way I've lived until now.  I want to know.(Snake reaches for his SOCOM and loads a clip into it.) Take a good look.  You won't get anothert chance for a while. You            should wash your face while you're at it.  This isn't a training            exercise.  Our lives are riding on this.  There are no heroes or            heroins.  If you lose, you're worm food. Yeah.(Snake spots Meryl's FAMAS on the ground.) Is that FAMAS functional? Unfortunately it's out of ammo. Where'd ya' get that Desert Eagle? I found it in the armory.  It's a .50 caliber Action Express.            There was a SOCOM pistol too, but I chose this. Hmmm.  So I got a leftover, huh.  Isn't that gun a little big for            a girl. Don't worry, I can handle it.(Snake holds his SOCOM out to Meryl.) C'mon.  Use my .45. Listen, I've used a gun like this since I was 8 years old.  I'm            more comforatble with it than I am with a bra.(Meryl pulls a clip of ammo out of her shirt and reloads her pistol.) If we're going to go to the north, we'll have to go through the            Commander's Room on this floor.  The overland route is blocked by            glaciers.  The door to the commander's room is security level            five.  This card will open it.(Meryl pulls out a card.) It was inside the pocket of the uniform I was wearing.(She hands the card to Snake.) Looks like he must have been guarding someplace important. Okay, let's go.  I know this place better than you.  I'll be            point man.  Follow me.(Meryl exits the bathroom, Snake follows her.) That's strange.  There's no guard. What happened to the music? I'll keep a look out.  Make sure you're ready, okay?(Snake and Meryl reach the entrance to the commander's room.) My head! ...Ooh.  It hurts!(Meryl kneels on the floor clutching her head.) What's wrong? Don't come here, Snake!(We see views of the commanders room, as if somebody is waiting for them.) Are you okay?  What happened?(Meryl stands up.  When she speaks her voice sounds different.) I'm fine.  Let's go.(Meryl walks to the door of the Commander's Room.) C'mon Mr. FOX-HOUND.  The commander is waiting.(They go into the Commander's Room.)(Meryl begins to jerk around.) Ah!(She points her handgun at Snake.  She begins to walk towards him, slowly. When she speaks her voice sounds strange.) Snake... do you... like me? What the!? Do you like me?  Hold me, Snake. What's wrong? Hurry... hurry!  Make love to me!!  Snake, I want you!!(We now see Psycho Mantis behind Meryl.  He is controlling her.) Who's that!? Huh?  You don't like girls?(Campbell calls on the Codec.) Snake, Meryl's not herself.  Don't use your weapon. It's psycho Mantis.  He's controlling Meryl.  That tune is his            mind control music. Don't use your weapon.  Try to knock her out.(Snake knocks her out easily.) Useless woman!(Snake takes not of Mantis' optical camouflage.) Optic camouflage, huh?  I hope that's not your only trick. You!  You doubt my power!?(Snake ignores Mantis and checks on Meryl, to make sure she isn't hurt.) Now, I will show you why I am the most powerful practitioner of            psychokinesis and telepathy in the world.(Mantis takes off his camouflage and we can see that he is floating in the air without any outside supports.  Snake is a bit surprised by this, he steps backwards.) No... there's no need for words, Snake.  I am Psycho Mantis.            That's right... this is no trick.  It is true power.(Snake whips out his SOCOM and points it at Mantis.) It's useless.  I told you... I can read your every thought. Now...            let me read your mind.  No... perhaps I should say your past.(At this point there are several things Mantis can say.  He will put together a combination of these to tell Snake somthing.) Still don't believe me?  Now I'll read more deeply into your soul.------------------------------------(Mantis tries something else.) You still don't believe me?  I will show you my psychokinetic            power.  Put your controller on the floor.  Put it down as flat as            you can... that's good.  Now I will move your controller by the            power of my will alone!!(Mantis now moves the controller by activating the vibration function.) What do you think now!?  Can you feel my power now!?  The            demonstration is over!!(Snake battles Mantis.  Mantis begins to control Meryl again.) You are powerful indeed, but I know your weak point! Meryl. Stand right where he can see you... and blow your brains out!!! Aaah!! Stop! Meryl!!(Snake must once again knock Meryl out.  Mantis is immensly frustrated when he succedes.) Why!? Yes, stand right there and blow your brains out.(After Mantis is defeated, Snake calls Campbell on the Codec.) Colonel, your niece is going to be okay. Thanks, Snake. I owe you one. Now that Mantis is beaten, Meryl's brainwashing is going to wear            off, right Naomi? Yes.  Why did you go so far out of your way to save her?  For            Campbell's sake... or... maybe it's because you like her? I don't want to see any woman die right in front of me. Oh really?  Since when did anybody's death bother you so much? Naomi!  It's true that Snake has killed a lot of people, that            doesn't mean he doesn't have a heart. It's okay, Colonel... she's right. .......(Snake walks over to Mantis.) So... you used the other... I... I wasn't able to read the future... A strong man doesn't need to read the future.  He makes his own. Perhaps so... But I will also read your future...(Meryl gets up from the floor.) To get to Metal Gear's underground maintenance base... you have to            go through that hidden door.  There's a hidden door behind the            bookcase.  The overland route... it's blocked by frozen glaciers.            Go past the communications towers.  Then use the tower's walkway.(While Mantis is talking we see what he is talking about.  Snake kneels down beside Mantis.) Why are you telling me this? I can read people's minds.  In my lifetime I have read the pasts,            presents, and futures of thousands upon thousands of men and            women.(Snake takes off Mantis's mask.  Meryl grabs her mouth, apparently horrified.) Oh... gross... And each mind that I peered into was stuffed with the same single            object of obsession.  That selfish and atavistic dsire to pass on            one's seed... it was enough to make me sick.  Every living thing            on this planet exists to mindlessly pass on their DNA.  We're            designed that way.  And that's why there is war.  But you... you            are different... You're the same as us.  We have no past, no            future.  We live in the moment.  That's out only purpose.  Humans            weren't designed to bring eachother happiness.  From the moment            we're thrown into this world, we're fated to bring each other            nothing but pain and misery.  The first person who's mind I dove            into was my father's.  I saw nothing but disgust and hatred for me            in his heart.  My mother died in childbirth... and he despised me            for it... I thought my father was going to kill me.(Now we see Mantis's spirit or soul floating above him.) That's when my future dissapeared.  I lost my past as well.  When            I came to, the village was engulfed in flames... Are you saying you burned your village down to bury your past? I see that you have suffered the same trauma.(Mantis laughs feebly.) We are truly the same, you and I... The world is a more            interesting place with people like you in it... I never agreed            with the Boss's revolution.  His dreams of world conquest do not            interest me.  I just wanted an excuse to kill as many people as I            could.(Meryl is taken aback by this.) You monster! Let him talk.  He doesn't have much time left. I've seen true evil.  You Snake.  You're just like the Boss... No,            you're worse.  Compared to you, I'm not so bad.(Mantis nods to Meryl.) I read her mind as well. Meryl's? I saw you there... you have a large place in heart.(Meryl touches Snake's shoulder.) A large place? Yes. A large place.  But I do not know if your futures lie            together.  I have a last request. What is it? My mask... put it back on. Okay.(Snake hesitates to put it back on while Mantis is talking.  He holds it over his face.) Like this... other people's thoughts force their way into my mind.            Before I die... I want to be by myself.  I want to be left alone            in my own world.(Snake places the mask on Mantis' face and secures it with the straps.) I'll open the door for you.(Mantis reaches out a hand and moves it so that the bookshelf blocking the door moves out of the way.) If you want to find your future, go through that door.  This is            the first time I've ever used my power to help someone.  It's            strange... it feels... kind of... nice.(Mantis' head lolls to one side.  Snake pauses for a moment and then stands up.) Let's go, Meryl. I'm sorry... Meryl? How could I let Mantis control my mind like that... If you're going to doubt yourself, I'll leave you here. You're right. Never doubt yourself.  Just let it make you stronger.  Learn            something from it. You're right.  I'm sorry.  I won't do it again.(Snake turns to leave.) Snake, can I ask you something? What!? About what Mantis said... I was just wondering... What?  What's the problem now? Oh no... nothing.  So tell me, Snake.  What's your name?  Your            real name? Name means nothing on the battlfield. How old are you? OLd enough to know what death looks like. Any family? No, but I was raised by many people. Is there anyone you like? I've never been interested in anyone else's life... So you are all alone.  Just like Mantis said. Other people just complicate my life.  I don't like to get            involved. You're a sad, lonely man. C'mon... let's go.(Snake and Meryl head out the hidden door.) Okay, I'll take point again.  Follow me.(Snake has to follow Meryl through a cave with a dozen or so wolf-dogs patrolling it.  When they see him they attack him.  Eventually, Snake meets up with Meryl on the other end of the cave.) What's wrong, Snake? I thought you were good with dogs?(They go into the next room.  They find themselves in the Underground Passage. Meryl stops Snake from advancing, because of mines.) Hold up, Snake!  This place is mined. The radar isn't working.  And since we can't use the mine            detector either... Leave it to me...(Meryl walks through the mine field and gets to the other side unscathed.) How did you know where the mines were? When Mantis dove into my mind, I could see where the mines were placed.            Are you impressed? Well... a little bit.(Now we see a set of crosshairs centered on Snake.  They move to Meryl.  She turns around.) Meryl!! What is it?(The laser point on Meryl moves down to her right thigh.) Meryl, get down!!!(Meryl is shot in the leg.) Aaaaaahhhh!! Meryl!!(Snake quickly takes cover behind the wall and looks over to Meryl.  She is on her knees now.  She is shot again, this time in her left leg.) Aaaaaaaaahhhh!!!(She collapses in a pool of blood and tries to reach her gun beside her.  The sniper acts quickly and shoots her in the arm.) Aaaaaaaghhhh!!!(Meryl gives up and lies on her back, bleeding badly.  Snake tries to movetowards her, but he is met by a bullet that hist the wall right near him.) Snake.... leave me and run... Meryl... I guess... I am a rookie after all... Don't worry, Meryl.  It's me they want. Even I know that, it's the oldest trick in the book.  The sniper's            using me for bait to lure you out. Damn!! Shoot me, Snake!! No! My gun... I can't reach it by myself. Don't move! I promised... I wouldn't slow you down!  I... I... I can still            help... I want to help you! Quiet down!  Save your strength! I was a fool, I wanted to be a soldier.  But war is ugly...            There's nothing glamorous about it.  Snake, please!  Save            yourself.  Go on living and don't give up on people!  Don't forget            me... Now get out of here!(Snake's Codec is ringing.) Meryl!  Damn!! Snake, it's a trap!  Sniper's trick to lure you out.The sniper's waiting for you to go and help Meryl so he can pick you off...Don't do it! It must be Sniper Wolf, FOX-HOUND's best shooter. Sniper's usually work in pairs, but this one's alone, huh? I know her.  She can wait for hours, days, or weeks, it doesn't            matter to her.  She's just watching and waiting for you to expose            yourself. Maybe so, but Meryl can't hold out that long... Snake, can you see Wolf from where you are? There's no where to hide between here and the tower... she must be            on the second floor of the tower. If Wolf is in the Communications Tower, she can see you perfectly!            It's the classic sniper's position!!  At that distance you won't            be able to hit her with a standard weapon either!  You'll need a            sniper rifle. Colonel!  Take it easy. ...... I'm going to save Meryl no matter what it takes. Okay, thanks. ...... What's wrong, Naomi? Nothing... I'm just surprised you're willing to sacrifice            yourself... you've got the genes of a soldier, not a savior. Trying to say that I'm only interested in saving my own skin? I wouldn't go that far but... I don't know what the hell my genes look like and I don't care. I            operate on instinct. Like an animal? I'm going to save Meryl.  I don't need an excuse. Okay... And I'm not doing it for someone else either.  I'm going to save            Meryl by myself.  Colonel, don't worry! Snake, thanks. I understand.  I'm sorry.(Snake goes off to find the PSG1.  He finds it in Armory.) You've got a PSG1?  Hurry up and save Meryl!(Snake hurries off to the Underground Passage.  He battles Wolf and defeats her.  Meryl has been taken away so he proceeds through the Underground Passage looking for her.  He reaches the door on the other end but three heavily armed guards rappel from the ceiling behind him.) Freeze!!(Snake holds up his hands and looks at the guards, waiting for something to happen.) It's hard to miss when you're this close.(Snake sees Wolf approaching him with her rifle pointed squarely at his chest.) Toss your weapon over here.  Slowly...(Snake slides his SOCOM across the floor, one of the guards picks it up.Wolf and one of the guards go closer to him.) You are a fool to come down here.. stupid man! A lady sniper, huh?Wolf:       Didn't you know that two thirds of the world's greatest assassins            are women?  Do you want to die now?  Or after your female friend?            Which will it be? I'll die after I kill you.(She lets out a small laugh.) Is that right?  Well at least you've got spirit.(Wolf lets down her gun and runs her hand through her hair.) I am Sniper Wolf and I always kill what I aim at.(She walks over to him and reaches up to his face.) You're my... special prey.  Got it?(She scratches Snake's cheek, drawing blood. Snake lets out a small grunt.) I've left my mark on you... I won't forget it.  Until I kill you, you'reall I'll think about.(The guard closest to Snake whacks him in the head with the but of his rifle.Snake falls to the floor, unconscious.) Uuuuhh!! Take him away!(Snake is dragged away back down the Underground Passage, away from where he was heading. We now see a faint outline of something onscreen, there are distant voices.) Don't kill him yet. I want him alive. Leave it to me. I want no more accidents like that DARPA Chief. Yes.  He's my target.  Mine alone.(We now see an overhead medical lamp.  There are background noises of computers running.) Can you hear me, Solid Snake? He's tougher than I thought... Do you know who I am?  I always knew that one day I would meet            you. The man who stole what was rightly mine... the man who stole            my birthright.  Me? I'm the man you stole everything good from.            And now, after the sacrifice of our brothers... after 30 long            years, finally the two of us meet.  The brother of light and the            brother of dark. Do you need his DNA too? Yes, I want a sample while he's still alive.  We need it to            correct the Genome Soldier's mutations. Then we'll be able to cure them? No.  We still have to get our hands on Big Boss's DNA. Have they given in to our demands yet? Not yet. They won't give in.  They're all hypocrites, every one of them. Is that your opinion as a Kurd? They always put politics first. That's right.  That's why they want to avoid any leak about their            precious new nuclear weapon. Boss, it looks like our friend is awake.(Snake is abruptly brought down somewhere to face Liquid, who is standing in front of him.  Snake is strapped into a revolving metal bed.) There definitely is a resemblance.  Don't you think, little            brother? Or should I say big brother?  I'm not sure... Anyway, it            doesn't matter.  You and I are both the last surviving "sons of            Big Boss".(Liquid's cell phone rings, he pulls it out hurridly.) It's me... Really?  Then what?  Those idiots!  All right Raven.            I'll be right there.(Liquid puts it away and talks to Wolf and Ocelot.) They're not responding to our demands.  We'll launch the first one            in 10 hours as planned. Damn Americans!! Looks like you read them wrong. Something's funny... Normally the Americans are the first ones to            the negotiating table.  They must think they've go something up            their sleeves. So it's come down to it, has it.  We're going to launch that nuke            and ride it all the way into history. I've got to take care of some launch preparations.  You're in            charge here, Ocelot.(Ocelot speaks to Sniper Wolf.) What about you?  Wanna stay for the show? I'm not interested.  It's time to feed the family.(Wolf shakes around a small canister of pills.  She takes a few out andswallows them.) So, you prefer your wolves to my show, huh? Ocelot, don't screw up like you did with the Chief. Yes, I know.  That was an accident.  I didn't think a pencil            pusher like him would be so tough. Well... his mental defenses were reinforced by hypnotherapy. Boss, what about that ninja? He killed 12 men.  Whoever he is, he's some kind of lunatic. Bastard took my hand... How could he have gotten in here? Perhaps there's a spy among us... Mantis is dead.  We've also got            to find out what killed Baker and Octopus.  We're shorthanded, so            make this little torture show of yours as short as possible. Torture?  This is an interrogation. As you wish.(Liquid turns to Snake.) See you later, brother...(Liquid leaves.  Wolf walks up to Snake.) Your woman is still in this world... Meryl... Catch you later, handsome...(Wolf leaves.) Once she picks a target, she doesn't think about anything else.            Sometimes she even falls in live with thwm before she kills them.            Finally, just the two of us.  How are you feeling? Not bad.  I caught a nice nap on this revolving bed of yours.  Too            bad I was sleeping alone. Glad to hear that.  This is some bed all right.  I'm about to show            you some of its nicer features... Where are my things? Oh don't worry.  They're all there.  Washington was taking quite            a chance sending you here.  Someone must have had a lot of faith            in your skill.  Huh, carrier boy? So, Metal Gear is armed with a new type of nuclear warhead, huh? Why don't you go ask Campbell for the full story? The Colonel? By the way, you get an optical disk from President Baker, didn't            you? What if I did? Is that the only disc?  There's no other data? What do you mean? There's no copy?  If not, that's fine. Is Meryl okay? She's not dead yet.  Wolf must have been feeling generous.  But if            you want her to stray that way you better start answering my            questions right now.  You were holding one card key.  Where are            the other two?  What's the trick behind that key!?  That weasel of            a president said there's some kind of trick to using the key. Hell if I know. I see.  No problem then.  We're going to play a game, Snake.  And            we'll find out what kind of man we really are.  When the pain            becomes too great to bear just give up and your suffering will            end.  But if you do, the girl's life is mine.(Snake is brought back to his cell.  He sees a dead body laying in the corner.) Looks like I've got a roommate.  The DARPA Chief!?  Whew...what a            stench!(Campbell calls on the Codec.) Snake, are you okay? I've been better. How's Meryl? ........ ........ Snake, the government has decided not to give in to their            demands.  We're trying to buy some more time. C'mon, Colonel.  Why don't you stop playing dumb?  I'm sorry about            Meryl but I want the lies to end now. What are you talking about? Metal Gear was designed to launch a new type of nuclear warhead,            wasn't it? ! You knew it all along, didn't you? ....... Why did you try to hide it? ...I'm sorry... Can't tell the grunts, huh?  ...You've changed a lot.  Metal            Gear... secret advanced nuclear weapons research...  Does the            White House know about this?  How deep does it go? As far as I know, as of yesterday, the President had not  been            briefed about the Rex Project. "Need to know basis", is that the idea? These are sensitive times.  Even sub-critical nuclear tests are            causing quite a stir. Plausible deniability, huh? Yes.  And tomorrow the President and his Russian counterpart are            scheduled to sign the Start 3 Accord. I get it.  That's the reason for the deadline. That's right, Snake.  And that's why we can't let the terrorist            attack go public. We still haven't even ratified Start 2 or dealt with the issue of            TMDs.  This has to do with the Presodent's reputation and            America's place as the dominant superpower. So patriotism is your excuse for circumventing the Constitution? Please, Snake... just stop them. Why should I? Because you're the only one who can. In that case, tell me the truth about this new type of nuclear            warhead. I told you before.  I don't knwo the details. I don't believe you.If the situation is so serious, why don't you            give in to their demands?  Let them have Big Boss's remains. You see... Or is there some reason that you can't do that?  Something you            haven't told me about? Publicly, the President has been very vocal in his opposition to            eugenics experiments.  We don't want the existance of the Genome            Army to go public. And that's the only reason? ....... Huh!  The hell with you! I'm sorry. The corpse of the DARPA Chief is lying right here next to me. Poor man. But it's strange.  He looks and smells like he's been dead for            days. All his blood's been drained out too. Drained!? Maybe to slow down decomposition? I have no idea. But the Chief only died a few hours ago, right? Right.  But he's already started to decompose. What could it all be about? SOmething in his blood that they wanted? I doubt it.  Just the nanomachines and the transmitter. Did the Chief tell them his detonation code? I'm afraid so.  It looks like they've got both codes and are            nearly ready to launch. Damn.  Is there any way to prevent it? It seems there's some type of emergency override device that can            cancel out the detonation code.  It's a countermeasure that            ArmsTech installed secretly.  You have to unlock it with three            special card keys. And where are those keys? I've got one of them.  I don't know where the other two are.            Besides, I'm locked up here. We've got no choice.  Forget about the keys.  Your top priority            now is to destroy Metal Gear itself.  Sorry to lay it all in your            lap, but you're all I've got.  Bust out of there and get to the            Communications Tower. ....... .......  Naomi, please talk to me.  Say something to take my mind            off the pain. What can I say? Anything. I...I'm not a very good talker. Please... tell me about yourself. Myself?  That's a tough one... Any family? That's not a very happy topic for me. I don't have any family.  No wait, there was a man who said he was            my father... Where is he? Dead.  By my own hand. Big Boss. What!? Big Boss!?  I had no idea. There was no way you could.  It happened in Zanzibar 6 years ago.            Only Snake and I know the real truth of what happened there. So, is it true?  Was Big Boss really your father? That's what he said.  That's all I know. And you were able to kill him, knowing that? Yup. How? He wanted it.  Besides, some people just need killing... That's patricide. Yup.  That's the trauma that Mantis was talking about.  The one            we share in common. Is that why you left FOX-HOUND? Let's just say that I needed to be alone for a while and Alaska            was the perfect place... ...Snake... I didn't have a real family either.  Just a big            brother who put me through school.  We weren't even blood-related            and he was much older than me. Where is he? He's dead... I'm sorry. ...Snake, is there a woman in your life? After you've been through as many wars as me, it's hard to trust anyone. Friends? Roy Campbell... Huh?  You're still calling me friend? Is that it? No, there was another... Frank Jaeger. What!? Big Boss's most trusted lietenant and the only member of FOX-HOUND            to ever recieve the codename "Fox".  Gray Fox. ........ I learned a lot from him. But... didn't you try to kill each other? That's true.  We did.  In Zanzibar.  But it was nothing personal.            We were just proffesionals on opposite sides, that's all. And you still call yourselves friends? Hard to believe?  War is no reason to end a friendship. That's insane. I first met him on the battlefield.  He was being held a prisoner            of Outer Heaven.  But he didn't look like a prisoner to me.  He            was always so cool and precise.  I was still green and he showed            me the ropes. You knew him well? No.  We never talked about our personal lives.  Sort of an            unwritten rule.  The nest time I saw him on the battlefield, we            were enemies.  We were fighting barehanded in a minefield.  I know            it sounds strange to most people.  But we were just two soldiers            doing our jobs.  It's like a sport. Men and their games!  You're like wild animals! You're right.  We are animals. So if you were friends, then how do you explain the Ninja's behavior? I don't know. It's your genes... they make you predisposed towards violence! You really like talking about genes, Naomi.  Why did you get into            genetic research anyway? I never knew who my parents were or even what they looked like. I            guess I got into genetics because I wanted to figure out why I'm            the way I am. So you studied about DNA? Yeah.  I thought if I studied my genetic structure, I'd find out            who I really was.  I thought that by analyzing a person's genetic            information, I could retrieve the blank spots in that person's            memory. Memory is stored in DNA? We're not sure.  But we know that a person's genetic fate is            determined just by the sequence of the four bases in their DNA. So what about my fate? You know my DNA sequence, don't you? Your fate?  I...I'm sorry.  I have no idea. Of course not.  You're a scientist, not a fortune-teller. .........(Snake ends his talk with Naomi and calls Otacon.) Otacon, are you still okay? Yeah.  Thanks to the stealth camouflage, that is. I have a favor to ask.  I need your help. I was wondering when you'd ask.  What should I do? I've been captured.  I'm locked up here in this cell. What cell? There's a big torture machine nearby. Okay.  I know it.  It's close.  I'll be there right away. Thanks.(Snake waits for Otacon to arrive.  The guard who si watching Snake has a bowelattack.) Aaachoo!  That witch!  She took my clothes!  Oh... my stomach.(The guard goes to the bathroom.) Hey! I'm here!(Snake looks around but doesn't see anybody.) Where? Here.(Otacon takes off his stealth camouflage.  He is by the cell door.) It's me. Otacon! Wow!  They even captured you!(Snake grabs Otacon and shakes him.) Hurry!  Get me out of here! Let me go!  That hurts! Hurry up! Is that how you ask a guy a favor?  Let me go.  Jeez, it's like            an animal's cage.  ...What a smell!(Snake points to the DARPA Chief.) Because of him. Eeyaaah!  It's the DARPA Chief!! If you don't hurry up and get me out of here, I'll be laying next            to him.Otacon: Those bastards!  This lock won't open up with a security card.  Youneed a key like the soldiers carry.Snake: So what are you doing here then?(Otacon reaches into his coat and pulls two objects out.)Otacon: I... I thought you might be hungry.  If you need more food, I can bringsome more later.(He has ketchup and a hamburger.)Otacon: Also, I got this level 6 card, it'll get you out of that torture room.Here... take this too.(Otacon takes yet another thing out of his coat.)Snake: What's that.Otacon: It's a hankerchief.  I got it from Sniper Wolf.Snake: Why?Otacon: I don't know why, but she's nice to me.Snake: Sounds like Stockholm Syndrome to me.Otacon: I was taking care of the dogs here.  After the terrorists take over,they were planning to shoot all the dogs.  But Sniper Wolf stopped them... sheeven let me feed them when I asked.  She likes dogs.  She must be a goodperson.  Please don't hurt her.Snake: Wake up you idiot!  She's the one who shot Meryl!Otacon: Well, that's all I can do...Snake: They're planning to launch a nuke!  I've got to stop them!Otacon: Then you'll have to get past the Communications Tower.Snake: First, you have to get me out of here!Otacon: C'mon...I'm trying my best...Snake: That guard's got the key.  You'll have to take him out!Otacon: Gimme a break!  I'm no soldier!  I can't take anybody out!Snake: You have to!!Otacon: I'll be killed!(The guard opens the bathroom door.)Otacon: Oh jeez.  He's coming back... see ya later...(Otacon turns and leaves.)Snake: Wait!(Snake waits for the guard to come back.  He breaks the ketchup bottle and usesit to make fake blood.  The guard is alerted.)Guard: What the hell!(The guard rushes into the cell and Snake quickly takes him out.  After getting all his stuff Snake heads for the Communications Tower.  Snake gets to the spot where Meryl was shot.  He stops and thinks back.)(Meryl is shot in both legs.  She collapses to the ground.  Meryl tries toreach her gun beside her.  The sniper acts quickly and shoots her in the arm.) Aaaaaaaaahhhh!!!(She collapses in a pool of blood and tries to reach her gun beside her.  The sniper acts quickly and shoots her in the arm.) Aaaaaaaghhhh!!!(Meryl gives up and lies on her back, bleeding badly.  Snake tries to movetowards her, but he is met by a bullet that hist the wall right near him.) Snake.... leave me and run... Meryl... I guess... I am a rookie after all... Don't worry, Meryl.  It's me they want. Even I know that, it's the oldest trick in the book.  The sniper's            using me for bait to lure you out. Damn!! Shoot me, Snake!! No! My gun... I can't reach it by myself. Don't move! I promised... I wouldn't slow you down!  I... I... I can still            help... I want to help you! Quiet down!  Save your strength! I was a fool, I wanted to be a soldier.  But war is ugly...            There's nothing glamorous about it.  Snake, please!  Save            yourself.  Go on living and don't give up on people!  Don't forget            me...(Campbell calls on the Codec.) Snake, about Meryl... Colonel, I'm sorry... Listen to me. I wasn't able to protect her. Snake, it's okay.  You did what you could, now let it rest. Colonel... She joined up of her own free will.  I'm sure she was prepared for            this. No.  You're wrong. ...? Meryl thought she had to become a soldier... thought it was the            only way.  She said she thought it woul;d bring her closer to her            dead father. She said that!? She wasn't ready for real combat.  I shouldn't have pushed her so            hard.... It's all my fault. That's not like you, Snake. Master.  What is it? Sorry for eavesdropping, but I just couldn't listen anymore. Master... Snake, you can have regrets if you want to... it's only natural.            But you can't keep attacking yourself for things that happened in            the past.  That road leads to madness, believe me. He's right.  Don't kick yourself.  It doesn't suit a legend like            you. And besides that, for all we know Meryl's okay, right? Mei Ling... Snake, forget about Meryl.  Stop Liquid.  That's what Meryl would            want, too. You're right.  Meryl would say the same thing. Snake. What? Meryl...she's pretty special to you, huh? Yes, she's special.  There aren't many women like her around. That's not what I meant... She's the Colonel's niece... and a combat buddy. Is that all?  C'mon... This is like a police interrogation. No, I just... I guess it's in the genes... The genes?  What are you talking about, Colonel? No, I just remembered about Naomi's grandfather.  I think Naomi            said he rose as high as assisstant secretary in the FBI during            Edgar Hoover's time. Is that right? Yes...yes, he was Japanese and he became a special undercover            investigator to nab the mafia. When was that? Oh.. sometime in the 50's, I guess. Where? New York, I think... Naomi, I thought you didn't have any family... Well...I...I researched it after I became an adult.  My            grandfather was already dead by the time I learned about him.  I            never even had the chance to meet him. Oh... Snake, good luck. Watch your back, Snake.******************************************************************************                       5.5   "I'm your shadow!"******************************************************************************(Snake signs off and heads for the Communications Tower.  he reaches the topbut as soon as he tries to cross to the second tower it is destroyed bymissile fire.) Damn!(Suddenly Liquid comes into view with his Hind.) Snaaaaake!!  I'm afraid I can't let you get past here! Liquid? You're not going any farther.  Die!!!(Snake looks over the side of the tower.) It's a long way down. If only I had a rope.  I should be able to            use that rope I got... What are you going to do? Take on a Hind with your bare hands?            Now you're mine! If I stay here, I'm finished.(Snake uses a rope that he acquired earlier to descend from the tower.  Hereaches tower B but finds that the stairs to the bottom are destroyed and hecannot pass. He heads back up.  He hears a noise so he whips around thecorner with his gun.) Don't shoot!!  It's me! Don't shoot!  It's me, Snake!! Otacon? How'd you get here? It wasn't as dramatic as your entrance, believe me. I'm afraid of            heights. You were watching? Yeah, I was watching.  I was riding in the back of their truck...            thanks to the stealth camouflage. How did you get up here? The elevator, of course. The 1st floor of the circular staircase was destroyed. That's why I took the elevator... The elevator was working? Yeah, that's right. You're incredible... like a movie hero or            something. No...you're wrong.  In the movies, the hero always saves the girl... ...You mean Meryl? ...Sorry... forget I said anything... Snake,            there's something I've really got to ask you. It's why I followed            you up this far...  Have you ever ...loved someone? That's what you came to ask? No I mean... I... I was wondering if even soldiers fall in love... What are you trying to say? I wanna ask you... Do you think love can bloom even on a battlefield? Yeah...I do.  I think at any time, any place... people can fall in            love with each other.  But... if you love someone, you have to be            able to protect them... I think so too. I have a favor to ask. Uh oh. Don't worry. It'll be easy. Umm...I told you before, I don't wanna hurt anyone. I don't want you to either. Okay... The elevator is stopped down there. I want you to get it to move.            You see? That's weird. It was working before, but now it isn't. ...Maybe the panel's broken? Can you fix it? It was working before. If it's the mechanism, leave it to me. I've got to go and swat a noisy fly. Okay. I'll stay here and hold the fort.  Good luck. You really look like hell. Are you okay? Don't worry.  If I do this, it doesn't matter.  I just pretend            like I'm not here. Then I'm not scared.(Otacon turns on his stealth camouflage.) Strange logic. I'm counting on you.(Otacon runs off to repair the elevator. Snake reaches the top of Comm. Tower Band comes face to face with Liquid's Hind.) So the Snake's finally come out of his hole?  Are you ready now...            my brother? Why are you calling me brother?  Who the hell are you!? I'm you.  I'm your shadow. What!? Ask the father that you killed! I'll send you to hell to meet him!!(Snake fights the Hind D and defeats it.  Liquid is now fighting to get it stablized.) C'mon, fly!  Damn!!  Snaaake!!(The Hind falls from the sky and explodes in a huge fireball.) See you in hell...Liquid.  That takes care of the cremation.(Otacon calls on the Codec.) Snake, the elevator's working. You fixed it? No, that's the weird thing.  It just moved by itself. It's headed            your way now. Is that so? Okay. That explosion before... what was it? Oh, I had to take out that helicopter. Helicopter? That's incredible, Snake! Listen. I just want to make sure again.  This is the way to get to            where Metal Gear is being stored? Yeah. The entrance to the underground maintenance base is towards            the back of the snowfield ahead. Okay. Find a safe place to hide out for a while.  I'm going            underground. I know, I know. You don't have to tell me. And stay outta my way. Don't try to be a hero or anything. Okay, call me if you need to. Snake, there's something I forgot to tell you before. What? There were five stealth camouflage prototypes in my lab. Yeah, so? If you take out the one I'm wearing, that leaves four. Hey. This isn't first grade math class. I thought I'd get one for you, so I went back to the lab and... Yeah? The four suits were missing. .........? Also...about the elevator that I checked out... It's really            strange.  It was like someone was intentionally holding it. When you were riding on it, did the weight limit warning go off? That's another thing that bothered me about it... The warning went            off and I know I couldn't be over the limit. How much do you weigh? About 135.  But that elevator had a weight limit of 650 pounds. It would take at least five people to go over that limit... L...Look out, Snake!  The guys who stole my stealth prototypes are            in there with you!!! Too late, Snake!  Now die!******************************************************************************                     5.6   Love on the Battlefield******************************************************************************(Snake battles the guards and defeats them.  Snake enters the snowfield but when he is halfway across he is shot at by a sniper.) Snake!! Are you okay!? Otacon! Were there any other stealth prototypes? No. There were only five. So...this isn't stealth camouflage then... What are you talking about? Someone's aiming at me... in the middle of this blizzard... ...It's her!!  Wolf? ...Sniper Wolf? Yes it's her! ...It's definitely her! Otacon... You sound like you're happy. No I'm not. So then what is it? Snake... please don't kill her! Are you insane!? Please. She's a good person! You'd know that if you talked to her... Listen to me, kid. She's a merciless killer. I can see you perfectly from here.  I told you... I'd never quit            the hunt. Now you're mine. Wolf! No, you can't! Don't get between a wolf and its prey! You're pretty good if you can hit me in this storm. You see?  Women naturally make better soldiers. Wolf! Don't do this!! Snake, I'm near.  Can't you sense me near you? It's a mistake for a sniper to reveal her location. Is that right?  Well I'm going to send you a love letter, my dear.            Do you know what that is? It's a bullet straight from my gun to            your heart. Please!!  Wolf!...Snake!...No! Quiet!  Don't get in our way! Now I'm gonna pay you back for Meryl... You men are so weak.  You can never finish what you start...(Snake battles Sniper Wolf and defeats her.  He finds her after the battlelying in a pool of blood in the snow.  He kneels down beside her.) I... I've... ...waited for this moment... I am a sniper. Waiting            is my job... Never moving a muscle... concentrating...(Wolf coughs up blood.) I am lung-shot. Y...you cannot save me.  Please... Just finish me            quick. I am a Kurd. I have always dreamed of a peaceful place like            this... A Kurd? So that's why you're called Wolf... I was born on a battlefield.  Raised on a battlefield. Gunfire,            sirens and screams... they were my lullabies... Hunted like dogs            day after day... driven from our ragged shelters... That... was my            life.  Each morning, I'd wake up... and find a few more of my            family or friends dead beside me.  I'd stare at the morning sun...            and pray to make it through the day. The governments of the world            turned a blind eye to our misery.  But then... he appeared. My            hero... Saladin... he took me away from all that... Saladin? ...You mean Big Boss? I became a sniper... hidden, watching everything through a            rifle's scope.  Now I could see war, not from the inside, but from            the outside, ...as an observer... I watched the brutality... the            stupidity of mankind through the scope of my rifle.  I joined this            group of revolutionaries... to take my revenge on the world.            But... I have shamed myself and my people.  I am no longer the            wolf I was born to be... In the name of vengeance, I sold my body            and my soul.  Now...I am nothing more than a dog. Wolves are noble animals.  They're not like dogs. In Yupik, the            word for wolf is "Kegluneq", and the Aleuts revere them as            honorable cousins. They call mercenaries like us "Dogs of War".            It's true, we're all for sale at some price or another. But you're            different. ...untamed... solitary.  You're no dog... You're a            wolf. Who are you? ...Are you Saladin? Wolf... you spared Meryl's life. She... she was never my real target... I don't kill for sport. Rest easy.  You'll die as the proud wolf you are. I finally understand.  I wasn't waiting to kill people... I was            waiting for someone to kill me.  A man like you... You're a hero.            Please... set me free.(Snake slowly rises and draws his gun.  Otacon comes running across the fieldstill in his stealth camouflage.) Why...!?  I loved you...(Wolf reaches her arm out to her side.) What is it? My gun... give it to me...(Otacon quickly scampers over to her gun and returns it to her.) She's part of me.(She clutches it to her chest.) Everyone's here now.  Okay, hero, set me free.(Snake slowly points his gun as Otacon turns around and puts his hands over his ears.) Goodbye...(The screen turns white as Snake fires.  Now both men are standing over her.) Snake, you said that love could bloom on a battlefield... But I            couldn't save her.(Snake bends down over Wolf's body.) What are you doing? Returning it to it's owner.  I don't need a hankercheif. Why? I don't have any more tears to shed.(Otacon starts sobbing.) I'm going to the underground base.  We're out of time. I know. You'll have to protect yourself now.  Don't trust anyone. Yeah... If I can't stop Metal Gear, this whoe place will probably be            bombed to hell. ...Yeah... We might not meet again. I'll hang onto my Codec.  I wanna keep helping. You can leave any time.  Get a headstart... a headstart on your            new life.(Snake begins to walk away.) Snake!!  What was she fighting for?  What am I fighting for!?            What are you fighting for!? If we make it through this, I'll tell you. Okay.  I'll be searching too.******************************************************************************                            5.7   The Truth******************************************************************************(Snake heads for the Underground Base.  Eventually, when he is on a cargo elevator, heading deeper into the base, he is contacted by Master Miller.) Snake, there's something I've got to tell you about Naomi Hunter? What about her? Is this conversation secure? Don't worry.  The monitor's off. Okay. What's up? I was in the FBI too, y'know. I didn't know that.  What's your point? Dr. Hunter's story about her background... about her grandfather            being an assistant secretary to Hoover in the FBI... Yeah? And then going undercover to investigate the mafia in New York... Yeah, what about it? It was all a big lie. What did you say? It was really bothering me.  Why would she lie about it? She lied? She might be a spy! Rediculous! C'mon.  Even a high school student could see past it.  The head of            the FBI at that time, Edgar Hoover... he was a well known racist.            Didn't Naomi say that her father was Japanese? Yeah... Well back then there wasn't a single Asian investigator.  Also,            in the 1950's the undercover mafia sting operations hadn't even            started yet.  They first started in 1960... in Chicago, not New            York. But... You better check it out.  The chief and the president dying, that            ninja... too many strange things are happening. Are you saying that Naomi might be behind it? I don't know.  Either that or she's working with the terrorists. Could it be...? If I find out anything, I'll call.  In the meantime, be careful!(Snake gets off the elevator and enters a large warehouse.  There are crows flying around in it.  He sees a large man sitting atop one of the boxes.  It is Vulcan Raven.  He stands up.) Welcome, kasack!!  This is the end of the road for you!  Right my            friends?(The ravens start making noise.) Listen.  They agree.  Ravens aren't scavengers like most people            think... They are simply returning to the natural world that which            is no longer needed.  Sometimes they even attack wounded foxes. You were the one in the M1 tank?  Must have been a tight fit for            a big boy like you. Ha ha ha ha ha... But that was no true battle.(Raven leaps down from the crate and lands with a thud.) The ravens and I were testing to see what kind of man you were.            The judgement is decided.  The ravens say you are a true warrior.(Something bright emanates from Raven's forehead and flies towards Snake.) Am I hallucinating?(A raven comes and sits on Snake's shoulder.) I... I can't move... The Raven has put the mark of death upon you.  Blood from the east            flows within your veins. Ah... your ancestors too were raised on            the barren plains of Mongolia.  Inuit and Japanese are cousins to            each other...  We share many ancestors, you and I... I don't have any crows in my family tree. You jest but indeed ravens and snakes are not the best of friends.            Nevertheless you will make a worthy adversary.  You live in Alaska            too.  You know of the World Eskimo-Indian Olympics? Yeah, I know it.  You must be a real threat in the "Muk-Tuk"            eating contest. Yes, you are right.  But there is another event that I excel at.  It is            called the "Ear Pull".  It is an event where two opponents pull            each other's ear while enduring the harsh cold.  It tests            spiritual as well as physical strength. You want to pull each other's ears? The form is different, but the spirit is the same.  Rejoice,            Snake! Ours will be a glorious battle. This isn't glorious.  It's just plain killing.  Violence isn't a            sport! Well, we will see if there is iron in your words!!(Snake battles Raven and defeats him.  Raven is now leaning against the wall, breathing hard.) Just as the Boss said... it is my existance wihich is no longer            needed in this world.(A raven lands on Raven's shoulder.) But my body will not remain in this place.  My spirit and my            flesh will become one with the ravens.  In that way I will return            to Mother Earth who bore me.  Snake!  My spirit will be watching            you... understand?(Snake walks over to Raven.) Snake, take this security card.  It wil open that door. Why? You are a snake which was not created by Nature.  You and the            Boss... you are from another world... a world that I do not wish            to know.  Go and do battle with him.  I will be watching from            above.  First, I'll give you a hint... The man who you saw die            before your eyes...(Scenes of the DARPA Chief dying are shown.) That was not the DARPA Chief.  It was Decot Octopus.  A member of            FOX-HOUND.  He was a master of disguise.  He copied his subjects            down to the blood.  So he drained the Chief's blood and took it            into himself.  But he wasn't able to decieve the Angel of Death. The Angel of Death?  But why go to so much trouble?  Why            impersonate the Chief? That is the end of my hint.  You must solve the rest of the riddle            yourself.(Ravens take off from all around and gather around Raven as Snake walks away.) In the natural world, there is no such thing as a boundless            slaughter.  There is always an end to it.  But you are different.(The raven's begin to eat away at Raven while he is still alive.) What are you trying to say? The path you walk on has no end.  Each step you take is paved with            the corpses of your enemies...  Their souls will haunt you            forever... you shall have no peace... Hear me, Snake!  My spirit            will be watching you!(Snake turns around and all that is left of Vulcan Raven is his Vulcan Cannon.)******************************************************************************                               5.8   Betrayal****************************************************************************** Master? It's about Naomi. Turn your monitor off... What about Naomi? Damn! Colonel, is Naomi there? No, she's away.  She's taking a short nap.  So what is this about           Naomi? Okay.  Maybe we'd better let the Colonel hear this too. Yeah.  Go on, Master... Well basically, Dr. Naomi Hunter is not Dr. Naomi Hunter at all. What!? I thought her story about her background sounded a little fishy, so           I checked it out. And...? There is an actual Dr. Naomi Hunter, or I should say there was           one... But she's not the woman we know.  The real Noami Hunter           disappeared somewhere in the Middle East.  Our Naomi must have           somehow gotten her identification papers. Then who is she really? She must be some kind of... spy. A spy!? Yes... maybe she's been sent to sabotage this operation. Are you saying she's with the terrorists? ...I don't want to believe it either.  But she is working for           FOX-HOUND. So you think she had a part in the uprising? Or she could be working with some different group all together. Different group...?  It couldn't be... Place her under arrest. What! She's betrayed us.  She needs to be arrested and interrogated to           find out who she's with. If she's one of their spies, then we're really in big trouble... What do you mean!? Oh nothing.... Have you let her in on some sort of vital secret or something? ......... Does this have anything to do with the mysterious deaths of the           DARPA Chief or the ArmsTech president? I... I have no idea. Anyway, we cannot allow her to participate any further in this           mission. Wait, wait a minute.  Without her, we can't complete this mission. I knew it.  You're hiding something. Give me some time.  I'll try to get it out of her... Hurry then.  We've got to find out who she is and what she's doing           here. I understand.  Snake, give me some time. I don't have any time left for you.(Snake signs off and heads into the room where Metal Gear REX is stored. Otacon calls on the Codec.) Snake... it's me. What's wrong?  Did you find a good place to hide? Yeah, thanks to the stealth gear.  It looks like they've finished           getting Metal Gear ready. How do you know that? I overheard them talking.  Where are you now? Right in front of Metal Gear... but it's strange. What is? There's nobody here... no guards, nobody patrolling... it's too           quiet. Maybe because they're all ready.  They said they even input the PAL           codes. What should I do? All we can do is use the override system that President Baker told           you about. But I've only got one of the three keys.  And besides that, like           Ocelot said, there's some trick to using the keys... Leave it to me... You got some kind of plan? Well, I'm in the computer roo right now.  I'm trying to access           Baker's private files. Baker's files?  Don't you need a password? Of course.  But there are ways... Are you a hacker? Yup.  That describes me pretty well. Does it look like you can get in? I don't know yet.  I'll give it a try. I'm counting on you...(Snake signs off.  Otacon calls later with an update.) It's me again. How's it going? Hmmm... not bad.  I just got past his third security level.  He was           a pretty careful guy. Do you think you'll break in soon? I've never met a system I couldn't bust into. Okay, keep trying.(Snake signs off again and later Otacon calls again.) Snake, I did it! You got past security? Bingo!!! Great.  So whaddya got? I accessed the confidential Metal Gear file. So what about the PAL override system that Baker talked about? I haven't found it yet. That's what I need to know! But Snake, I found something else! What? The secret behind the new nuclear weapon!  Just as I thought, the           nuclear warhead is designed to be fired from the rail gun, like a           projectile... It doesn't use fuel so it isn't considered a missile.           That way it can get around all sorts of international treaties. Pretty sneaky. Yes, but effective.  And that's not even the scariest thing about           this weapon. I can't wait to hear this. It's a stealth weapon! You mean it won't show up on radar? Yeah.  The truth is... they've been working on a stealth missile           since the late 70's. Why weren't they able to develope one until now? Because of the missile's rocket propulsion system... it will be           picked up by enemy satellites. Oh yeah, that makes sense. But unlike a missile, the rail gun doesn't burn any propellant.  So           it can't be detected by any current ballistic missile detection           systems. An invisible nuclear warhead... Totally impossible to intercept.  And on top of that, it's got a           surface piercing warhead designed to penetrate hardened           underground bases. We learned that lesson in the Gulf War. This thing could mean the end of the world! It's the ultimate weapon.  And from a political point of view, it           avoids the problem of nuclear reduction and nuclear inspections.           Colonel, is this true?  Are you listening? I'm listening... If word of this got out, it could delay the signing of the Start 3           Treaty and cause a huge international incident. Yeah, it would be nasty.  The United States would be denounced by           the UN... it could even bring the President down... Did you know this, Colonel? I'm sorry... You've changed, Colonel. I won't make any excuses... Snake, listen to me.  This new nuclear weapon... it's never           actually been tested, only simulated. You mean they ran a computer model? Yeah, that's why they were conducting this excercise.  They needed           to get actual data to back up the simulation. What were the results of the excercise? It looks like it went better than they hoped for.  But...I can't           find the data anywhere on this network.  You'd think that data as           important as that would be carefully recorded... It was.  President Baker gave me an optical disc with all of the           test data. What!? Do you still have it? No, Ocelot took it from me. Damn... The terrorists have replaced the dummy warhead with a real warhead.           Once they input the detonation codes, they should be ready to           launch. So you think they can do it? Well the dummy warhead was designed to be identical to the real           thing, so I think so. Did you find out how to override it yet? Not yet.  It must be in a separate file.  Right now, I'm looking           through all of Baker's personal files. We're counting on you...(Snake enters the control center of the Rex hangar.  He sees Liquid and Ocelot talking.) Okay. I've entered the PAL codes and disengaged the safety device.           We can launch anytime. There's still no response from Washington. It looks like we'll have           to show them that we mean business. Should I set it for Chernoton, Russia? No, there's been a change. The new target is...Lopnor, China. Why Boss? I'm sure neither you nor Mr. Gurlukovich would really like to see           a nuclear bomb dropped on your Motherland, right? Liquid! But why? There's nothing there. Wrong. It's a nuclear test site. A nuclear test site? If we nuke a major population center, the game's over... But a           nuclear explosion at a test site can still be concealed from the           public. Meanwhile Washington will be worried about the retaliatory           strike from China. That'll probably mean top secret talks between both countries'           leaders... Of course. And in the process, the President will be forced to           divulge the existence of a new and highly destabilizing nuclear           weapon to the Chinese. What do you think that will do to the U.S.'s           reputation? Or the President's? And with the CTBT, that means that China and India... I see... Yes. When the other countries hear about this new weapon, they'll           all want to contact us. Washington won't be very happy when we           start selling their own system to the highest bidders. Yes. The           President will break. He will give in to our demands. Big Boss's DNA and one billion dollars... One billion dollars! That money will be used to cure our genome soldiers as well. I'm           also including the FoxDie vaccine in our demands. FoxDie... It killed Octopus and the ArmsTech president... So it's           true that it affects older people first. Mantis might not have been           affected because he wore a mask. Wolf wasn't infected either. Perhaps due to those tranquilizers           she always took. Something to do with the adrenaline level in the blood? Or maybe           it's just because this FoxDie was still experimental and they           haven't worked out all the bugs yet... In any case, have you heard from your friend, Colonel Sergei           Gurlukovich at the Spetznaz? He still has doubts about the ability of Metal Gear. He said we           can talk after Metal Gear's test launch is successful. He is a very prudent man. There's nothing to worry about. The Colonel wants Metal Gear and           the new nuclear weapon so bad he can taste it. If Russia wants to           regain its position as a military superpower, they need to           reinforce their nuclear arsenal. They need a nuclear weapon that           can't be intercepted. Metal Gear will allow them to gain first           strike capability over the rest of the world. Their regular army is in shambles and they think they can restore           their country's military power with nuclear weapons? Gurlukovich...           he's no warrior... he is a politician. But he's the one who gave us the Hind and most of our other heavy           firepower. He's got over a thousand soldiers under his command. If we joined           forces we could put up quite a resistance here. Since Mantis died,           the genome soldiers' brainwashing has started to wear off. I'm           worried about the men's morale. An alliance with the Russians would           boost that as well... What are you saying? We're not going anywhere. We're going to dig in here. We could still escape... We've got the most powerful weapon ever made and we're about to           ally with Gurlukovich's forces. Are you going to fight the whole world? And what's wrong with that? We can launch a nuclear warhead at any           target on this planet... A nuclear warhead invisible to radar. And           on top of that, this base is full of spare nuclear warheads. Once           we get the DNA and the money, the world will be ours!  What about your promise to Colonel Gurlukovich? I have no interest in the revival of Mother Russia. ...You're not thinking of reviving Big Boss's dream? From today, ...call this place "Outer Heaven". Big Boss's dream... But Boss,... you're not worried about the PAL being overridden? If           the code is entered again, it'll be deactivated. No need to worry. The DARPA Chief and the ArmsTech president are           both dead. Does Snake know how the override system works? You interrogated him. Don't you know? He didn't have any keys on him. Good. Then no one can stop Metal Gear now. By the way, what should we do with that woman? Want me to kill her? Let her live. She's Campbell's niece and Snake cares for her...           We'll keep her as our ace in-the-hole. Meryl... she's alive. Snake, I found Baker's top-secret files! Great job. How's it going there? They've finished inputting the PAL codes. So how do we deactivate           them? Okay...y'see the override system that the president was talking           about... It can also be used to input the detonation codes. Y'see           if you insert the keys when the warhead is active, you deactivate           it. And if you insert them when it's inactive, it becomes           activated. And you can only use the keys once. Only once, huh. Yeah...you'd better get started. We don't have much time. But it takes three keys, right!? I've only got one of them! Hold on a minute. Y'see that's the trick. You already have all           three keys! What are you talking about!? The card key is made of a shape memory alloy. Shape memory alloy? Yes. It's a material that changes shape at different temperatures.           The key is made out of it! This card key? Yeah. The card key changes shape at different temperatures. So this key is actually three keys in one...clever. Can you see the input terminals in the center of the Control           Room... I see them. Those three laptop terminals are for the emergency input. There           should be a symbol on each screen... Each symbol corresponds to a           different key. Input the keys in order from left to right. The           left one's for the room temperature key. See the symbol? Next to           that goes the low temperature key. The one on the right is the           high temperature key. Okay, I got it. First I change the shape of the card and then I           input them in order, right? That's right. All you do is insert the card keys. After you insert           the key into the module, a hard disk reads the information           contained on it. Once you've finished with all three terminals, the           code input process is complete. But here's the thing. You can only           use the key three times. It's an emergency system and it's only           meant to be used once. The world is riding on that key, Snake. Who's that!!(Ocelot fires a bullet at Snake.  Snake is startled and loses his grip on the key.  It tumbles over the railing and falls into the drainage ditch.) Damn!! The key fell in the drainage ditch! Snake!! This is bullet-proof glass! There's no way in! I'll enjoy           watching you die! Snake, you've got to get that key!(Snake finds the key and heads back up to the control room to input the code.) PAL code number one confirmed. Awaiting PAL code number two... Okay, that takes care of PAL code number one... Now PAL number           two... freeze the key. PAL code number two confirmed. Awaiting PAL code number three... Snake. It's about Naomi Hunter... Then you should talk to the Colonel. He's looking into it. Turn your monitor off. Okay it's off. No one else can hear us. Go ahead. Sorry, but I didn't want the Colonel to hear. Okay, so what's up? I've got a good friend in the Pentagon... Yeah... He's the one who told me about it... It looks like the DIA recently           developed a new type of assassination weapon. An assassination weapon? Snake, have you ever heard of something called "Fox Die"? No... Fox Die? ...Liquid and others were talking about it... Yeah. It's some kind of virus that targets specific people. I           don't know all the details, but... What are you trying to say? It's too similar. What is!? The cause of death. Didn't the ArmsTech president and the DARPA           Chief, I mean Decoy Octopus,... die of something that looked like           a heart attack? Yeah...? Well, apparently Fox Die kills its victims by simulating a heart           attack. No... You're telling me that Naomi was behind it? Snake, try to remember. Did Naomi give you some kind of injection? ...The nanomachines. She was in the best position to have done it, but I don't know what           her motive was. ...Does the Colonel know? I'm not sure. But he still hasn't questioned her. Okay. I'll ask him myself. Colonel, what's new with the Naomi           situation? I just placed Naomi under arrest. Arrest? She was sending coded messages towards the Alaskan base. I didn't           want to believe it, but she must be working with the terrorists. Are you sure? I'm afraid so. She's being interrogated now. What kind of interrogation? Well...I'd like to avoid the rough stuff, but we don't even have           any sodium pentathol here. Call me if you find out anything. So it's true, isn't it? Naomi...I can't believe it. That means the Fox Die vaccine must be around somewhere. Listen. I've got bigger things to worry about. But Snake...you might be infected too, you know. All I can do is leave it up to the Colonel.(Snake goes to input the rest of the PAL Codes and during the process he gets a Codec call.) Snake, can you hear me?  It's Naomi... Naomi!? ...what the hell!? Campbell and the others are busy right now...I'm on a different           Codec. Naomi, is what the Colonel says true? ...Yes.  But not everything I said was a lie. I don't know myself.           I don't know my real name or even what my parents looked like.  I           bought all my identification. But my reason for getting into           genetics was true. Cause you want to know yourself, right? That's right. I want to know where I came from...m...my age, my           race... anything. Naomi... I was found in Rhodesia sometime in the 80's... a dirty little           orphan... Rhodesia? What's now known as Zimbabwe? Yes. Rhodesia was owned by England until 1965 and there were lots           of Indian laborers around.  That's probably where I got my skin           color from, but I'm not even sure about that... Naomi, you're too worried about the past. Isn't it enough to           understand who you are now? Understand who I am now!?  Why should I? No one else tries to           understand me.  I was alone for so long... until I met my big           brother and him. Your big brother? Yes.... Frank Jaeger. What!? He was a young soldier, when he picked me up near the Zambezi           River.  I was half-dead from starvation and he shared his rations           with me. Yes. Frank Jaeger, the man who you destroyed, was my brother and my           only family. Gray Fox? We survived that hell together, Frank and I.  He protected me. He's           my one connection... the only connection that I have to my past. And he brought you back to America? No.  I was in Mozambique when "he" came. Who is "he" ? ...You mean Big Boss? He brought us to this land of freedom , this America. But then he           and my brother went back to Africa to continue the war.  And that's           when it happened... You killed my benefactor and sent my brother           home a cripple.  I vowed revenge and joined FOX-HOUND.  I knew it           was my best chance to meet you and I prayed for the day that I           ould... So were your prayers answered? Yes. I waited two long years... To kill me?  Is that all you cared about? Yes. That's right.  Two years.  You were all I thought about for           two long years...like some kind of twisted obsession... Do you still hate me? ...Not exactly.  I was partly wrong about you... What about Liquid and the others? No. I'll have my revenge on them too. Naomi...you didn't kill that doctor too, did you?  The one that           used Gray Fox for his genome experiments... ...No...that was my brother.  Afterwards I covered it up and helped           him hide out... So that Ninja...I mean Gray Fox... he's come here to kill me? ...I don't think so.  I think he just came here to fight you... I           wasn't sure before, but now I think I understand.  A final battle           with you... that's all he lives for. I'm sure of it... ...Fox...no... Naomi, tell me something... ...about FoxDie?  FoxDie is a type of retrovirus that targets and           kills only specific people.  First, it infects the macrophages in           the victim's body.  FoxDie contains smart enzymes, created through           protein engineering.  They're programmed to respond to specific           genetic patterns in the cells. Those enzymes recognize the target's DNA? Right. They respond by becoming active, and using the macrophages,           they begin creating TNF epsilon.  It's a type of cytokine, a           peptide which causes cells to die.  The TNF epsilon is carried           along the bloodstream to the heart, where they attach to the TNF           receptors in the heart cells. And then...they cause a heart attack? The heart cells suffer a shock and undergo an extreme apoptosis.           Then... the victim dies. Apoptosis...you mean the heart cells commit suicide... Naomi... ...What? ...You must have programmed that thing to kill me too, right? Do I           still have time? Naomi, I don't blame you for wanting me dead.  But           I can't go yet. I still have a job to do. Listen, Snake.  I'm not the one who made the decision to use           FoxDie. You weren't? You were injected with FoxDie as a part of this operation. I just           wanted to let you know that... No, that's not the whole truth...           the real thing that I wanted to tell you was... Snake, I... I... Hey! What are you doing!? Eeeek!!  Ooooh.... Snake..... ...Snake, I can't allow Naomi to make any more unauthorized           transmissions.  Naomi's been removed from this operation. What happened to Naomi!? What did she mean when she said that           FoxDie was a part of this operation!?  Colonel, let me talk to her! I won't. She's under arrest. ...you double crossed me! Snake, there's no time for that! Right now your job is to stop Metal Gear! ...Okay, Snake!?(Snake inputs the second PAL code.) PAL code number two conirmed.  Awaiting PAL code number three. Okay, there goes PAL code number two. Next comes PAL number           three... warm the key.(Snake Inputs the third PAL code.) PAL code number three confirmed. PAL code entry complete...           Detonation code activated. No! Why! Ready for launch...(Snake recieves a Codec call from Master Miller.) Thank you Snake.  Now the detonation code is completed. Nothing can           stop Metal Gear now. Master, what's going on? You found the key and even activated the warhead for us too. I           really must express my gratitude.  Sorry to have involved you in           that silly shape memory alloy business.  We weren't able to learn           the DARPA Chief's code.  Even with Mantis' psychic powers, he           couldn't read his mind.  Then Ocelot accidentally killed him during           the interrogation.  In other words, we weren't able to launch the           nuclear device and we were all getting a little worried.  Without           the threat of a nuclear strike, our demands would never be met. What do you mean? Without the detonation codes, we had to find some other way. That's           when we decided...you might prove useful, Snake.  First I thought           we might get the information from you, Snake.  So I had Decoy           Octopus disguise himself as the DARPA Chief.  Unfortunately Octopus           didn't survive the encounter. ...thanks to FoxDie. You mean you had this planned from the beginning? Just to get me to           input the detonation code!? Huh? You didn't think you made it this far by yourself, did you? Who the hell are you!? In any case, the launch preparations are complete.  Once the world           glimpses the power of this weapon, the White House will have no           choice but to surrender the FoxDie vaccine to me. Their ace-in-the-           hole is useless now... Ace-in-the-hole? The Pentagon's plan to use you was already successful... in the           torture room. Snake, you're the only one who doesn't know.  Poor fool. Who are you anyway!? I'll tell you everything you want to know.  If you come to where I           am, that is. Where are you? Very close by. Snake, that's not Master Miller! Campbell, you're too late. Master Miller's body was just discovered at his home.  He's been           dead for at least three days.  I didn't know because my Codec link           with Master was cut off.  But Mei Ling said his transmission signal           was coming from inside the base! So who is it? Snake, you've been talking to... ...Me... dear brother. Liquid!? How the...!? You've served your purpose.  You may die now!******************************************************************************                     5.9   "A name from long ago..."******************************************************************************(Snake dashes outside and sees Liquid about to clmib intot he cockpit of Rex. He levels his SOCOM at him.) Liquid!! Snake, did you like my sunglasses? You'd point a weapon at your own           brother? Why did you disguise yourself as Master? So I could manipulate you more easily. And you performed quite well           I must say. Although the boys at the Pentagon are probably saying           the same thing... What the hell are you talking about!? Following orders blindly with no questions asked. You've lost your           warrior's pride and become nothing more than a pawn, Snake. What? Stopping the nuclear launch, rescuing the hostages... It was all           just a diversion. A diversion? The Pentagon only needed for you to come into contact with us.           That's what killed the ArmsTech president and Decoy Octopus. You don't mean... That's right. You were sent in here to kill us so they could           retrieve Metal Gear undamaged along with the bodies of the genome           soldiers. From the beginning, the Pentagon was just using you as a           vector to spread FoxDie! Fox Die! ...It can't be! Are you telling me Naomi was working with           the Pentagon? They thought she was. But it seems that Dr. Naomi Hunter couldn't           be controlled so easily. What? We've got a spy working in the Pentagon. He reported that Dr.           Hunter altered FoxDie's program just before the operation. But...no           one knows how or why. I wonder... maybe they arrested her so they could find out the           answer to that. No doubt. But I had no idea she was motivated by such petty           revenge... we still don't know what changes she made to FoxDie's           program. Oh well. It doesn't matter. I've already added the FoxDie           vaccine to my list of White House demands. There's a vaccine? There must be. But that woman is the only one who really knows.           Anyway, it might prove to be unnecessary. Why is that? You were successful in coming into contact with all of us, so we           must have all been exposed to the virus. It's true that the           ArmsTech president and Decoy Octopus were killed by FoxDie... But           Ocelot, myself, and you, the carrier, were apparently unaffected. A bug in the virus' programming? Hmm, could be. In any case, if it doesn't kill you then I'm not           worried either. After all, our genetic code is identical. So it's true...you and I are... Yes, twins, but we're not ordinary twins... we're twins linked by           cursed genes. Les enfants terribles. You're fine. You got all the           old man's dominant genes. I got all the flawed, recessive genes.           Everything was done so that you would be the greatest of his           children. The only reason I exist is so they could create you. I was the favorite, huh. That's right! I'm just the leftovers of what they used to make you.           Can you understand what it's like to know that you're garbage since           the day you were born!? But...I'm the one father chose. ...So that's why you're so obsessed with Big Boss. Some warped           kind of love. Love!? It's hate!! He always told me I was inferior and now I'll           have my revenge!! You should understand me, brother. You killed           our father with your own hands! You stole my chance for revenge!           Now I'll finish the work that father began. I will surpass him...           I will destroy him! You're just like Naomi. Well I'm not like you. Unlike you, I'm proud of the destiny that           is encoded into my very genes. Yeah!(Liqud hops into Rex's ockpit.) Damn!! Snake! Your blood will be the first to be spilt by this glorious           new weapon. Consider it an honor... a gift from your brother. Now,           I'll show you! The power of the weapon that will lead us in the           21st century!  It's moving... How do I stop it? Did that do it!? Damn!!!  Nice try, Snake! Die!!(Liquid moves in to crush Snake but Grey Fox leaps out of nowhere and holds up Rex's foot while Snake moves away.) Hurry! Get away! Gray Fox!! A name from long ago. It sounds better than Deepthroat. So it is you!? You look terrible, Snake. You haven't aged well. I'll send you back to hell!(Fox leaps away and fires a few shots into the Radome.  He lands calmly behind the box where Snake is taking cover.) Fox, why!? What do you want from me!? I'm a prisoner of Death. Only you can free me... Fox, stay out of this... What about Naomi? She's hell bent on           taking revenge for you. Naomi... You're the only one who can stop her. No...I can't. Why? Because I'm the one who killed her parents. I was young then and           couldn't bring myself to kill her too. I felt so bad that I decided           to take her with me. I raised her like she was my own blood to           soothe my guilty conscience. Even now she thinks of me as her           brother... Fox... From the outside, we might have seemed like a happy brother and           sister. But every time I looked at her, I saw her parents' eyes           staring back at me... Tell her for me. Tell her that I was the one           who did it.(Liquid spots the two behind the box and tries to shoot them.) There you are! We're just about out of time. Here's a final present from           Deepthroat. I'll stop it from moving! Fox!(Fox dashes out from behind the box and heads straight for Rex.  Liquid spots him and fires the rail gun at him.  Fox leaps up into the air but Liquid reacts quickly to this.  He sweeps the laser up into the air and it connects with Fox's arm.  It is severed but this seems to have no effect on Fox. He quickly moves to a high vantadge point on the wall, readies his gun, and is pinned against the wall by Rex's nose.  Liquid begins to taunt him.) In the Middle East, we don't hunt foxes, we hunt jackals. Instead           of foxhounds, we use royal harriers. Fox! How strong is that exoskeleton of yours? Snake, are you just going to sit by and watch him die?(Fox summons his last bit of strength and fires as many shots as he can into the radome of Rex.  It is destroyed.  Liquid is forced to open up the cockpit now.) A cornered fox is more dangerous than a jackal! He destroyed the radome... Impressive. You are indeed worthy of the codename "Fox"! But now           you're finished! Uuunnggh!! .....Now! Fire the Stinger! Fox! Can you really shoot? You'll kill him too! Now in front of you. I can finally die. After Zanzibar, I was taken           from the battle neither truly alive nor truly dead... an undying           shadow in the world of lights. But soon... soon. It will finally...           end.(Liquid drags Fox off of his perch and lets him fall to the ground.  He tries to crush him once more.) Die!(Fox is now clinging onto himself.  His exoskeleton will break in a matter of moments.) Snake, we're not tools of the government or anyone else! Fighting           was the only thing... the only thing I was good at, but... At least           I always fought for what I believed in... Snake... farewell.(Liquid applies all the weaight he van on top of Fox.  His exoskeleton gives out and he is crushed.) Fooooooox!!! Foolish man. He prayed for death... and it found him. You see? You           can't protect anyone!! Not even yourself! Die!!(Snake battles rex one last time and succedes in firing a missile into Rex's cockpit.) Snake, I'll crush you into dust! Ooooh! Uuuuff!(Rex suddenly blows up and Snake is thrown against the wall by the explosion. He is unconscious.  Moments later we see Liquid approaching casually.  The screen goes dark.)******************************************************************************                  5.10   Confessions of a Dangerous Mind******************************************************************************(Snake reawakens on the head of Rex.  Liquid apparently dragged him up there.) Sleeping late as usual, ...eh Snake? Liquid... you're still alive... I won't die. ...as long as you still live. Too bad. It looks like your revolution was a failure. Just because you've destroyed Metal Gear doesn't mean I'm done           fighting. Fighting? What are you really after? A world here warriors like us are honored as we once were... as           we should be. That was Big Boss's fantasy. It was his dying wish! When he was young, during the Cold War, the           world needed men like us. We were valued then. We were desired.           But things... are different now. With all the liars and hypocrites           running the world, war isn't what it used to be... We're losing our           place in a world that no longer needs us. A world that now spurns           our very existence. You should know that as well as I do. After I           launch this weapon and get our billion dollars, we'll be able to           bring chaos and honor... back to this world gone soft. Conflict           will breed conflict, new hatreds will arise. Then! ...we'll           steadily expand our sphere of influence. But as long as there are people, there will always be war. But the problem... is balance. Father knew what type of a           balance was best... Is that the only reason? Isn't it reason enough? For warriors such as us. I don't want that kind of world! Ha! You lie! So why are you here then? Why do you continue to           follow your orders while your superiors betray you? Why did you           come here? ...... Well... I'll tell you then. You enjoy all the killing, that's why. What! Are you dnying it? Haven't you already killed most of my comrades? That was... I watched your face when you did it. It was filled with the joy of           battle. You're wrong! There's a killer inside you... You don't have to deny it. We were           created to be that way. Created? Les enfants terribles... the terrible children. That's what the           project was called. It started in the 1970's. Their plan was to           artificially create the most powerful soldier possible. The person           that they chose as the model was the man known then as the greatest           living soldier in the world... Big Boss... But father was wounded in combat and already in a coma when they           brought him in. So they created us from his cells... with a           combination of 20th century analog cloning and the Super Baby           Method. Super Baby Method? They fertilized an egg with one of father's cells, and then let it           divide into eight clone babies. Then they transferred the clones           to someone's uterus and later intentionally aborted six of the           fetuses to encourage strong fetal growth... You and I were           originally octuplets. Octuplets... Yes. The other six of our brothers were sacrificed to make us. We           were accomplices in murder before the day we were even born. So it           was you and I. Two fertilized eggs with exactly the same DNA.           But... they weren't finished yet. They used me as a guinea pig! To           create a phenotype in which all of the dominant genes were           expressed.... to create you. I got all of the recessive genes! ....... You took everything from me before I was even born! But... you and           I aren't his only children. What? The Genome Soldiers. They too are his progeny, carrying on his           genetic legacy.  But they're different. They're digital. With the           completion of the Human Genome project the mysteries of humanity           were laid bare... Thanks to father’s DNA, they were able to identify more than sixty           ‘soldier genes’ responsible for everything from strategic           thinking... to the proverbial ‘killer instinct’. Those ‘soldier           genes’ were transplanted, into the membrane of Next Generation           Special Forces. That’s how they became the Genome Soldiers. That’s           right... The Genome Soldiers that you’ve been killing are our           brothers, with the same genes as ours. The Genome Soldiers!? That's right. They are our brothers, created artificially through           the alignment of nucleotides  to mimic our father's genes. They           too are the product of numerous sacrifices. Sacrifices? Human experiments.(Footage of the Gulf War is shown) 1991, the Gulf War. The military secretly injected soldiers with           the soldier genes. The Gulf War Syndrome that hundreds of thousands           of returning soldiers complained about, was a side effect of it. Hah. Everyone knows that the Gulf War Syndrome was caused by           exposure to depleted uranium used in anti-tank rounds. That was just a cover story issued by the Pentagon. First they           tried to say it was post-dramatic stress disorder, then chemical           or biological weapons. The poison gas detection units and the           anti-sarin injections. They were all just a cover up of this secret           genetic experiment. So then... the so called Gulf War Babies that have been reported           by Gulf War veterans are... Yes... They too our are brothers and sisters. So the Genome Soldiers mean that the experiments were a success? Success? Don’t be a fool! They’re a complete failure! We’re on the           verge of extinction. What!? Have you ever heard of the Asymmetry Theory? Nature tends to favor           asymmetry. Those species which have gone extinct all show signs of           symmetry. The Genome Soldiers suffer from the same problem... signs           of symmetry. So do I, as do you.  !!! That's right. We are all on the verge of death at the genetic            level. We don't know when or what type of disease will occur.           That’s why we need the old man's genetic information. You want Big Boss's DNA so you can save your family? It's very            touching. In Nature, family members don't  mate with each other. And yet           they help each other to survive. Do you know why? It increases the           chance that their genes will be passed on to a new generation.           Altruism among blood relatives is a response to natural selection.           It's called the Selfish Gene Theory. You're telling me that your genes are ordering you to save the           Genome Soldiers? You can't fight your genes. It's fate. All living things are born           for the sole purpose of passing on their parents' genes. That's           why I'll follow what my genes tell me. And then I'm going to go           beyond. In order to break the curse of my heritage. And to do           that... first I will kill you.  Look behind you! Meryl!? Is she alive? I'm not sure. She was alive a few hours ago. Poor girl kept calling           your name. Meryl... Stupid woman. Falling in love with a man who doesn't even have a           name... I have a name! No! We have no past, no future. And even if we did, it wouldn't be           truly ours. You and I are just copies of our father, Big Boss. Let Meryl go! As soon as we finished our business. We're almost out of time. ...You're talking about FoxDie? No. It seems now that the Pentagon knows that Metal Gear is           destroyed, they've arrived at a decision. They won't even need a           BDA (battle damage assessment). If you want the details why don't           you ask your precious Colonel Campbell? Colonel! Can you hear me? Yes... I'm listening. What is the Pentagon trying to do!? Colonel! Colonel! Answer me! The Secretary of Defense has taken over active control of this           operation. He's on his way there by AWACS. What for? To bomb the place. What!? Not only that. B-2 Bombers just lifted off from Galena Airforce           Base. They're carrying B61-13 surface- piercing tactical nuclear           bombs. What?! Metal Gear is destroyed. Tell the Secretary of Defense! The Secretary of Defense heard that Naomi double-crossed us and           he's worried about Fox Die. Now that there's no more danger of a           nuclear strike from Metal Gear, he's going to do whatever's           necessary to cover up the truth of what really happened here. He's going to drop a nuclear bomb to vaporize all the evidence           along with anyone who knows anything... Don't worry, Snake. I'll stop the nuclear strike. How? I may only be a figurehead here, but I'm still officially in            command of this mission. If I issue an order to delay the strike.           It'll confuse the chain of command and at least buy you some time.           It'll give you a chance to escape! But Colonel, if you do that... It's okay, Snake. ...The truth is FOX-HOUND was already the subject           of an undercover investigation. Meryl was transferred to this base           just before the terrorist attack... as a way of manipulating me. Those bastards... I'm sorry. They forced me to cooperate in exchange for her life.           You'd better get out of there, Snake. Are you sure? ...It'll be bad for you. Don't worry. It's the least I can do for you after all the lies. Colonel... I'm ordering them to cancel the bombing run. After that there's no           turning back... Aaaah! What are you doing!? Snake! Mei Ling, what happened to the Colonel!? ...I don't believe it!! What happened!? Snake, the Colonel...!! Roy Campbell has been relieved of duty. This is the Secretary of           Defense, Jim Houseman. Put the Colonel back on! He's been placed under arrest for leaking top-secret information           and for the crime of high treason. Ridiculous! Yes, he's a ridiculous man. He truly believed that he was in           command of this operation. You bastard...! There won't be a speck of evidence left. I'm sure the President           would want the same thing. The President ordered this? The President is a busy man. I have complete authority here. How do you plan on explaining a nuclear attack on Alaska to the           media? Don't worry. We've prepared a convincing cover story. We'll simply           say that the terrorists exploded a nuclear device. ...Smart. You'll be murdering everyone here. The scientists, the           Genome Army, everyone... Donald... the DARPA Chief is already dead... So you didn't mean to kill the DARPA Chief after all? He was my friend. And you could care less about what happens to everybody else, huh? Well, if you give me the optic disc, I might consider saving them. What are you talking about? Metal Gear's test data! Donald was supposed to bring it back. I don't have it. I see. Oh well that's okay... You two are an embarrassment from the           1970's. ...our country's dirty little secret. You can’t be allowed           to live. Well, the bombs will be dropping soon, and you two have a           lot of catching up to do. Farewell.(Houseman cuts the transmission as Liquid begins to undo Snake's hands.) There's no way out for us. Let's finish this before the air           strike. You stole everything from me. Only your death can satisfy           me. Only your death can return to me what is rightly mine. She'll           make a beautiful sacrifice for our final battle.           Do you see this? It will be the time limit for our final battle.           This nuclear module is set to detonate at the precise moment of           her death.           If you win... you might still be able to save her. You could enjoy           one brief moment of love… before the end. If you cross this line,           you’ll fall... At this it will kill even you.******************************************************************************                               5.11   Escape******************************************************************************(They fight and Snake defeats Liquid.  Liquid falls off the edge of Rex and plummets to the ground.) Snaaaaaaaaake!!!(Snake runs over to Meryl lying down.) Meryl?  ....Meryl?   Meeeeryyyyylll!(Meryl's head falls over when Snake lifts her up.  She is dead.) Forgive me.  Damn!  I gave into my fear.  I gave into my pain.  I           sold your life to save my oen...  I'm a loser.  I'm not the hero           you thought I was.  I'm nothing!  Meryl, I'm sorry!  Forgive me.(Otacon approaches.) Meryl can't forgive anyone anymore. Otacon? She's gone, Snake. ...Because of me.... I guess blaming yourself makes it easier, huh?  If you do that, you           can keep the pain at a nice, safe distance. What the hell do you know?  Meryl's dead.  I lost. So, are you going to stay here and die?  Along with her?  Snake,           people die.... But death is not defeat.  That's what Hemmingway           said.  I lost Wolf too.  But that wasn't defeat.  She and I will           be together forever.  We didn't lose anything. Together forever? It's true that Wolf is dead.... but our love didn't die with her.           Life's more than just a game of win or lose.  Don't you think?           Let's live, Snake.  There's a parking garage right next door.  We           can get to the surface from there.  C'mon.  I released all the           security locks.  It'll be okay.  We can excape.... You have my word           on it. Otacon... you've changed. I'm through regreting the past...  Life isn't all about loss y'know.(The building begins to shake.) It's started!  Those guys.... seems like they only hurry when           they're destroying things.  Good.  let 'em destroy it.  But they           can't destroy the human spirit. Okay.  Let's go!  Meryl, I hope you're still watching me.  Maybe I           can prove myself to you after all.(Snake and Otacon start to leave.) C'mon, hustle! Snake, it's cold outside.  You'll freeze like that.(Snake spots his sneaking suit on the ground beneath Rex.) My sneaking suit! You better hurry...  Hurry!(Snake puts on his sneaking suit.) Now you look like yourself again.(As they dash outside, Snake takes one last look at Meryl.)(Snake and Otacon escape to the outside but are followed by Liquid.  After a brief gun-fire exchange they emerge into sunlight and both jeeps crash. Snake and Otacon are both pinned under the jeep.) Otacon, are you okay? I guess so.... Otacon, can you move? It's no use. What happened to Liquid? I don't know, but I hope he's dead. Liquid is dead... Uh oh!(There is a noise by the other jeep and Liquid comes out from behind it.) Snake!(Liquid points his FA-MAS at Snake's head but he doesn't fire.) ...Snaaaake... Fo... Fox...?(Liquid falls to the ground, dead.) If he's dead, that means.... Don't think about it, Snake. What happened to the air raid? No stealth bombers in sight.(Snake calls Campbell on the Codec.) Snake, can you hear me? Colonel! Are you okay? Colonel, what happened? The Secretary of Defense has been arrested. Early retirement. Arrested? I was able to get into contact with the President. Metal Gear, the           training exercise...all of it...it was all the Secretary of Defense           acting alone. Acting alone? What happened to the air raid and the nuclear strike? The orders were rescinded. The F117s and the B2 Spirits have           returned to the base. Once again, I have complete authority over           this operation. I see... Washington isn't stupid enough to use nukes to cover up a few           secrets. I wonder about that. In any case, the danger's over... Thanks, Snake. Colonel, about Meryl... I already know. ..... Colonel Meryl was my daughter.... What!? I didn't find out until recently.  I got a letter from her           mother... my dead brother's wife... I was going to tell her after           this operation was over. Colonel, I.... It's okay, Snake.  Thanks anyway. Snake, I'm sorry I... I kept a           lot of things from you. It's okay, Colonel. Snake, I'm not a Colonel. Oh that's right. I've got a present for you. There's a snowmobile close to you. Mei           Ling saw it on the satellite photos. This time of the year the           glaciers are pretty calm. You should be able to ride right out of           there. I'll bet the boys at the DIA and the NSA never expected you           to come home alive. Me neither. I better not show my face around here. No danger of that. You two officially died after your jeep sank           into the ocean... That's not too far from the truth. Also there's a helicopter waiting for you on Fox Island. Okay, Roy. Are you going to be okay? Don't worry. I've got an insurance policy... a hard copy of all           Mei Ling's data. As long as I've got that, you, me and Mei Ling           will be fine. The battery on these nanomachines will run out soon. They won't be           able to follow us. I guess we won't meet again. Don't worry. I'll pay you a visit sometime. Really? I'll look forward to that. Roy, just tell me one thing. What? About Fox Die. Meryl will be fine. She wasn't included in its programming. What about me? It killed Liquid... Naomi said that she wants to talk to you face to face about that. How is she? Don't worry. Mei Ling's with her right now. I'm switching over to           Naomi. Snake, it's me... Naomi... I heard...about my brother... I'm sorry... but he had one last message he wanted to say to you.           He told me to tell you to forget about him and to go on with your           own life. Frankie said that? Yeah. He also said he'll always love you... Naomi, your brother           just saved you, me and the whole world. He fought with every ounce           of strength in his body. Maybe... maybe now he's finally found some peace. He wasn't really           my brother anymore... Ever since he fought with you in Zanzibar           he's been like a ghost. A ghost looking for a place to die... Naomi, Liquid died from Fox Die too. What about me? When am I           gonna go? That's up to you. What do you mean? Everybody dies when their time's up... Yeah, so when's mine up? It's up to you how you use the time left to you. Live, Snake.           That's all I can say to you. ..........(Snake and Meryl begin to walk down towards the snowmobile.) Each person is born with their fate written into their own genetic           code... it's unchangeable, immutable... But that's not all there           is to life. I finally realized that. I told you before. The reason           that I was interested in genes and DNA. Because I wanted to know           who I was... where I came from. I thought that if I analyzed my           DNA I could find out who I was, who my parents were. And I thought           that if I knew that, then I'd know what path I should take in life.           But I was wrong. I didn't find anything. I didn't learn anything.           Just like with the Genome Soldiers... you can input all the genetic           information, but that doesn't make them into the strongest           soldiers. The most we can say about DNA is that it governs a           person's potential strengths... potential destiny. You mustn't           allow yourself to be chained to fate... to be ruled by your genes.           Humans can choose the type of life they want to live.           Snake, whether or not you're in the FoxDie program isn't important.           The important thing is that you choose life... And then live! Don't           you think, Snake?           Don't worry.  I'm going to choose life too. Until today, I've           always looked for a reason to live. But from here on, I'm going to           just live.           Genes exist to pass down our hopes and dreams for the future           through our children. Living is a link to the future. That's how           all life works. Loving each other, teaching each other... that's           how we can change the world. I finally realized it. The true           meaning of life... Thank you, Snake.(Snake finds the snowmobile and pushes it out into the open.) Until today, I've lived only for myself.  Survival has been the           only thing I cared about in my life. That's not just you.  That's how everyone is. I only felt truly alive when I was staring Death in the face.  I           don't know, maybe it's written into my genes. What about now? I want to enjoy life.  I really do.  How about you, Otacon? Me?  I feel like a new man. So what are you going to do?  Continue your research? No, I'm finished with science...  I'm interested in human           psychology            now. Sounds good... The whole reason I got into science in the first place was because           I was no good with people.  I was scared of them.  I was scared of           life.  I thought that I could never understand them because they're           so illogical.  But I've finally learned how to like people.  I'm           not afraid anymore. You and I are more alike than I thought... I'm just tired of always being a spectator in life.  I'm ready to           live.  I'm gonna stand on my own two feet.  I'm not gonna hide           anymore. You're giving up your stealth camo? Huh? Oh yeah... You can have it.(Otacon hands his Stealth Camouflage to snake.) ...So, this is where we say goodbye to our loves as well... Want me           to drive? No thanks.  I'd rather do it myself. No problem. Where to, Snake? My real name is David, Otacon. I'm Hal, Dave. Oh, that's right... Hal.  Hal and Dave?  That's a good one.  Ha ha           ha ha ha... Maybe we should take a trip to Jupiter... So where are you going, Dave? Hmmm. I think it's time for me to look for a new path in life. A new path? A new purpose. Will you find it? I'll find it.  I know I'll find it.(Snake starts up the snowmobile and they ride off into the sunset.)(The credits are shown.) You mustn’t allowed yourself to be chained to fate... to be ruled           by our genes. Humans can choose the type of life they want to live.           The important thing is that you choose life... And then... live!(The screen fades to black.  We can hear Ocelot talking to somebody over a telephone or radio.) Yes sir.  The entire unit was wiped out.  Those two are still           alive.  The vector?  Yes sir.  FoxDie should become activated           soon... Right on schedule.           Yes sir.  I recovered all of Rex's dummy warhead data.  ...No sir.           My cover is intact.  Nobody knows who I really am.  Yes the DARPA           Chief knew my identity but he's been disposed of.           Yes.  Thank you.  Good-bye.  Mr. President.                                   THE END******************************************************************************                    T H E   M E R Y L   E N D I N G Snaaaaaaaaake!!! Meryl? Meryl!? Uh, Uh, uhnnn... Snake? Is that you? Snake! You're alive! Thank           God! Meryl? Meryl, are you okay? Are you okay... Is that all you can say? Meryl, it must have been terrible... It wasn't that bad. I didn't give in to the torture. Torture? ...And things even worse than that... I was fighting too. Just like           you. You're a strong woman. Fighting them... made me feel closer to you. I felt like you were           there with me. It gave me the strength to go on. But I was scared. ...I'm sorry. Don't say that... But it made me realize something. During all the           pain and shame there was one thing I was sure of... a single hope           that I held onto... And that hope kept me alive...           Snake, I wanted to see you again...(Otacon calls on the Codec.) Snake, it's me. Otacon, good news! Meryl's okay. All right!!! You saved her, man. Good job! I got some bad news too. We're about to be bombed. Oh boy. I guess we're considered expendable. Is there a way out of here? A way out? ...Uh, yeah. You can take the loading tunnel to the           surface. There's a parking garage right next to you. The tunnel           leads from there to the surface. The door in front? No. It's a small entrance to the west of that door. How about the security? I just unlocked it. Who do you think you're talking to? I'll take           care of security along your escape route too... What are you going to do? Me? I... I'll stay here. Are you crazy! I need a little more time to take care of your escape route. But... Unlocking the security doors is difficult work. Only I can do it. Otacon? Don't worry. I'm staying here. It's my own decision. Otacon, this is a hardened shelter, but they're going to use a           surface piercing nuclear bomb. It won't hold. I'm through regretting the past... Life isn't all about loss,           y'know... ........ Snake, I'm a complete person now. I've found a reason to live. Good. Don't die on me. Same to you.  Take care of Meryl, okay. I will... Okay I gotta go. I promise I'll do something about your escape           route. Thanks. "Thanks"... oh, that sounds nice. ...I believe in you. Thanks, Snake. Let's get the hell out of here. ...What about him...? Where is Otacon!? He's... He's... fighting right now... With his old self... to be           the man he wants to be. He's fighting for us too? Yeah, and I don't want it to be in vain. ...Me too. Meryl. ...Snake. Meryl. It's started... I must be heavy... It looks like we're not gonna have a love scene after all. Looks that way. Too bad... Let's get out of here! Snake, it's freezing outside. You need some clothes. There's my Sneaking Suit! Hurry up. Hurry! Hmm... Looking good, Snake. Meryl, are you okay? ...Yeah, just a little shook up. Meryl, can you move? It's no good. I can't move. What happened to Liquid? I can't see him either... Liquid is dead... Uh oh!(There is a noise by the other jeep and Liquid comes out from behind it.) Snake!(Liquid points his FA-MAS at Snake's head but he doesn't fire.) ...Snaaaake... Fo... Fox...?(Liquid falls to the ground, dead.) Die... If he's dead, that means... Don't say it, Snake. What happened to the air raid? No Stealth bombers in sight. Snake, can you hear me? Colonel! Are you okay? Colonel, what happened? The Secretary of Defense has been arrested. Early retirement. Arrested? I was able to get into contact with the President. Metal Gear, the           training exercise...all of it...it was all the Secretary of Defense           acting alone. Acting alone? What happened to the air raid and the nuclear strike? The orders were rescinded. The F117s and the B2 Spirits have           returned to the base. Once again, I have complete authority over           this operation. I see... Washington isn't stupid enough to use nukes to cover up a few           secrets. I wonder about that. In any case, the danger's over... Thanks, Snake. Colonel, you can rest easy. Meryl's fine. Really? Thanks... Thank you, Snake.  Snake, I'm sorry I... I kept           a lot of things from you. It's okay, Colonel. Snake, I'm not a Colonel. Oh that's right. I've got a present for you. There's a snowmobile close to you. Mei           Ling saw it on the satellite photos. This time of the year the           glaciers are pretty calm. You should be able to ride right out of           there. I'll bet the boys at the DIA and the NSA never expected you           to come home alive. Me neither. I better not show my face around here. No danger of that. You two officially died after your jeep sank           into the ocean... That's not too far from the truth. Also there's a helicopter waiting for you on Fox Island. Dr. Hal Emmerich should be somewhere on the base. I want someone           to bring him in. I understand. Leave it to me. Okay, Roy. Are you going to be okay? Don't worry. I've got an insurance policy... a hard copy of all           Mei Ling's data. As long as I've got that, you, me and Mei Ling           will be fine. The battery on these nanomachines will run out soon. They won't be           able to follow us. I guess we won't meet again. Don't worry. I'll pay you a visit sometime. Really? I'll look forward to that. Roy, just tell me one thing. What? About Fox Die. Meryl will be fine. She wasn't included in its programming. What about me? It killed Liquid... Naomi said that she wants to talk to you face to face about that. How is she? Don't worry. Mei Ling's with her right now. I'm switching over to            Naomi. Snake, it's me... Naomi... I heard...about my brother... I'm sorry... but he had one last message he wanted to say to you.           He told me to tell you to forget about him and to go on with your           own life. Frankie said that? Yeah. He also said he'll always love you... Naomi, your brother           just saved you, me and the whole world. He fought with every ounce           of strength in his body. Maybe... maybe now he's finally found some peace. He wasn't really           my brother anymore... Ever since he fought with you in Zanzibar           he's been like a ghost. A ghost looking for a place to die... Naomi, Liquid died from Fox Die too. What about me? When am I           gonna go? That's up to you. What do you mean? Everybody dies when their time's up... Yeah, so when's mine up? It's up to you how you use the time left to you. Live, Snake.            That's all I can say to you. ..........(Snake and Meryl begin to walk down towards the snowmobile.) Each person is born with their fate written into their own genetic           code... it's unchangeable, immutable... But that's not all there           is to life. I finally realized that. I told you before. The reason           that I was interested in genes and DNA. Because I wanted to know           who I was... where I came from. I thought that if I analyzed my           DNA I could find out who I was, who my parents were. And I thought           that if I knew that, then I'd know what path I should take in life.           But I was wrong. I didn't find anything. I didn't learn anything.           Just like with the Genome Soldiers... you can input all the genetic           information, but that doesn't make them into the strongest           soldiers. The most we can say about DNA is that it governs a           person's potential strengths... potential destiny. You mustn't           allow yourself to be chained to fate... to be ruled by your genes.           Humans can choose the type of life they want to live.           Snake, whether or not you're in the FoxDie program isn't important.           The important thing is that you choose life... And then live! Don't           you think, Snake?           Don't worry.  I'm going to choose life too. Until today, I've           always looked for a reason to live. But from here on, I'm going to           just live.           Genes exist to pass down our hopes and dreams for the future           through our children. Living is a link to the future. That's how           all life works. Loving each other, teaching each other... that's           how we can change the world. I finally realized it. The true           meaning of life... Thank you, Snake.(Snake finds the snowmobile and pushes it out into the open.  When they get on it Meryl hands Snake a bandana.) Look. I found this. Let's keep it. As a reminder. Of what? A reminder of a successful mission or the first time we           met? A reminder of how to live. Until today, I've lived only for myself.           Survival has been the only thing I cared about in my life. That's not just you. That's how everyone is. I only felt truly alive when I was staring Death in the face. I           don't know, maybe it's written into my genes. What about now? What do your genes say about your future now? Maybe it's time I live for someone else. Someone else? Yeah. Someone like you... Maybe that's the real way to live. So...where to, Snake? David. My name is David... Okay, so where to, Dave? Hmmm. I think it's time we look for a new path in life. A new path? A new purpose. Will we find it? We'll find it. I know we'll find it.(Meryl spots an animal out on the ice.) What are those? Caribou. To the Aleutians, the Caribou is a symbol of life. It'll           be spring here soon... For us too... Yeah. Spring brings new life to everything. It's a time for hope.           I've lived here a long time... But Alaska has never looked more           beautiful. The sky... the sea... the caribou... and most of all...           You... I think I'm gonna like this new life... C'mon. Let's enjoy life...(Snake and Meryl ride off into the sunset.)(The credits are shown.) You mustn’t allowed yourself to be chained to fate... to be ruled           by our genes. Humans can choose the type of life they want to live.           The important thing is that you choose life... And then... live!(The screen fades to black.  We can hear Ocelot talking to somebody over a telephone or radio.) Yes sir. The entire unit was wiped out. Those two are still alive.           The vector? Yes sir, FoxDie should become activated soon... Right           on schedule.           Yes, sir. I recovered all of Rex's dummy warhead data. ...No, sir.           My cover is intact. Nobody knows who I really am. Yes, the DARPA           Chief knew my identity, but he's been disposed of.           Yes. The inferior one was the winner after all. ...That's right.           Until the very end, Liquid thought he was the inferior one. Yes,           sir. I agree completely. It takes a well-balanced individual...           such as yourself to rule the world. No, sir.  No one knows that           you were the third one... Solidus. ...What should I do about the           woman? Yes sir. I'll keep her under surveillance.           Yes. Thank you. Good-bye. Mr. President.
